:lyric: |-
  [D]You [Dmaj7]sheltered me from [Bm]harm, [D] 
  kept me [G]warm [Gm6], kept me [D]warm [Dsus2] [A] 
  [D]You [Dmaj7]gave my life to [Bm] [D]me, 
  set me [G]free [Gm6], set me [D]free [Dsus2] [A] 
  [Em]The finest years I ever [A] [Asus4] [A]knew 
  [Em]were all the years I had with [A]you 
   
  Chorus: 
  And [G]I would give [D] [Em]anything I [A]own, 
  [G]Give up my [D]life, my [Em]heart, my [A]home. 
  [G]I would give [D] [Em]everything I [A]own [Asus4] [A] 
  just to [G]have you back [D]again. 
   
  [D]You [A/C#]taught me how to [Bm]love, [D/A]what it's [G]of, [Gm6]what it's [D]of [A] 
  [D]You never [A/C#]said too much but [Bm]still you showed the way 
  and I [C]knew [G], from watching [D]you 
  [Em]Nobody [G]else could ever [Asus4]know [A]the [Em]part of [G]me that can't let [A]go 
   
  Bridge: 
  Is there [Bm]someone you know, you're [D]loving them so 
  but [Gmaj7]taking them all for [G]granted? 
  You may [Em]lose them one day, someone [G]takes them away 
  and they [C]don't hear the words you long to [A]say.
