:lyric: |-
  [Dm]Run away, run a[Bb]way if you can't speak [F] 
  Turn a page on a [C]world that you don't need 
  [Dm]Wide awake and you're [Bb]scared 
  That you won't come [F]down now [C] 
  Didn't I [Dm]tell you you were gonna [Bb]break down 
  Didn't I [F]warn you, didn't I [C]warn you 
  Better take it [Dm]easy, try to find a [Bb]way out 
  Better start be[F]lieving in your[C]self 
   
  [F]We build it [C]up, we tear it [Dm]down 
  We leave our [Bb]pieces on the [F]ground 
  We see no [C]end, we don't know [Dm]how 
  We are [Bb]lost and we're falling 
   
  [Dm]Hold onto [Bb]me 
  You're all I [F]have, all I [C]have 
  [Dm]Hold onto [Bb]me 
  You're all I [F]have, all I [C]have 
   
  [Dm]Now and then there's a [Bb]light in the darkness 
  [F]Feel around till you [C]find where your heart went 
  [Dm]There's a weight in the [Bb]air but you can't see [F]why, [C]why 
  Didn't I [Dm]tell you you were gonna [Bb]break down 
  Didn't I [F]want you, everybody [C]wants you 
  Tell me what you're [Dm]needing, give into your [Bb]bleeding 
  Never any [F]feeling for your[C]self 
   
  [F]We build it [C]up, we tear it [Dm]down 
  We leave our [Bb]pieces on the [F]ground 
  We see no [C]end, we don't know [Dm]how 
  We are [Bb]lost and we're falling 
  Hold onto me You're all I [F]have, all I [C]have 
  [Dm]Hold onto [Bb]me You're all I have, all I [C]have 
   
  ... 
  Didn't I [Dm]tell you you were gonna [Bb]break down 
  Didn't I [F]warn you, didn't I [C]warn you 
  Better take it [Dm]easy, try to find a [Bb]way out 
  Better start be[F]lieving in your[C]self 
   
  [F]We build it [C]up, we tear it [Dm]down 
  We leave our [Bb]pieces on the [F]ground 
  [F]We see no [C]end, we don't know [Dm]how 
  We are [Bb]lost and we're falling 
   
  [Dm]Hold onto [Bb]me 
  You're all I [F]have, all I [C]have 
  [Dm]Hold onto [Bb]me 
  You're all I [F]have, all I [C]have 
   
  Can you [Dm]hold [Bb]onto [F]me [C] 
  Can you [Dm]hold [Bb]onto [F]me [C] 
  [Dm]Run away, run a[Bb]way if you can't [F]speak
