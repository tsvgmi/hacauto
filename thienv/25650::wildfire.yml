  Verse 1: 
  [Em]Darling, please take my [G]hand

  Nothing's gonna hold you down for[Am]long 
   
  Chorus: 
  S[C]ometimes we break so [Em]beautiful 
  [D]And you know you're not the only [Am]one 
  [C]I breathe you in so sweet and [Em]powerful 
  [D]Like a wildfire burning up inside my [Am]lungs

  You are needed here, you are [D]enough 
  And nothing's gonna hold you down for [Am]long
