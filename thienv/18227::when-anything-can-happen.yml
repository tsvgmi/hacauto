  [Em]Freedom in [D]the [C]balance 
  [Am]What you [D]want, you’ll have [Em]it 
  (What you want, you’ll have it) 
  [Em]Nothing [D]like a [C]challenge 
  [Am]When anything [D]can [Em]happen 
   
  [Em]So you reach [D]out to the [C]sky 
  [Am]I (I, I) [D]know the [Em]feeling 
  [Em]When you’re [D]holding on for [C]dear life 
  [Am]When anything [D]can [Em]happen 
  [Em D C Am D Am]

  When anything can happen) 
   
  [Em]Dreaming in [D]your pala[C]ce 
  [Am]What you want, [D]you’ll have [Em]it 
  (What you want, you’ll have it) 
  [Em]You’re living [D]in the [C]open 
  [Am]When any[D]thing can [Em]happen 
   
  [Em]So you reach [D]out to the [C]sky 
  [Am]I (I, I) know [D]the [Em]feeling 
  [Em]When you’re holding [D]on for dear [C]life 
  [Am]When anything [D]can [Em]happen 
  [Em D C Am D Em] 
  (When anything can happen) 
   
  [Em]Everybody [D C] 
  [Am]Needs [D]an [Em]escape 
  [Em]You’ve got to [D]hold on tight [C]and 
  [Am]Never let go, [D]never let [Em]go (hey) no no 
   
  [Em]Everybody [D C] 
  [Am]Needs [D]an [Em]escape 
  [Em]You’ve got to [D]hold on [C]tight and 
  [Am]Never let go, [D]never let [Em]go (hey eh hey) 
   
  [Em]When any[D]thing can [C]happen 
  [Am]When any[D]thing can [C]happen.
