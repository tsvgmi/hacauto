  Verse1: 
  [D]She, ties her [F#m]hair up [A]tight 
  Puts her [D]armour on, when she [F#m]steps out [E]side 
  [D]She, lives in [F#m]black and [A]white 
  And the [D]colours gone, but its [F#m]in her [E]eyes 
   
  Pre-chorus: 
  Time and [D]time again we're going back to the start 
  And I [F#m]try and try again to bring some light to the dark 
  You know [D]everyday's a battle and it tears her apart 
  And I [F#m]don't know [E]why 
  And I'm [D]picking up the pieces when they fall to her feet 
  She's been [F#m]fighting off her demons so she'll never be free 
  She's been [D]hiding in the shadows, yeah, it's hard to believe 
  No, I [F#m]don't know [E]why 
   
  Chorus: 
  [A]Love, don't ever [E]change the way you [F#m]are 
  You light the [D]sky just like a [A]star 
  I don't care [E]what you see 
  You're [F#m]beautiful to [D]me, oh 
   
  Verse2: 
  [D]She, she never [F#m]gets it [A]right 
  And it [D]feels like rain on a [F#m]perfect [E]night 
  [D]And I'll, I'll be a [F#m]hand to [A]hold 
  She can [D]push me hard, but I [F#m]won't let [E]go 
   
  Pre-chorus: 
  Time and [D]time again we're going back to the start 
  And I [F#m]try and try again to bring some light to the dark 
  You know [D]everyday's a battle and it tears her apart 
  But [F#m]don't you [E]cry 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  Verse3: 
  [A]Love, open your [E]heart and let it [F#m]go 
  You're so [D]amazing. Don't you [A]know? 
  I don't care [E]what you see 
  You're [F#m]beautiful to [D]me (You're beautiful to me) 
   
  Bridge: 
  [A]The light breaks through your hair and 
  [E]They all stop and stare and 
  [F#m]I'd go anywhere 
  Oh, [D]why can't you just see that? 
  [A]I'm crazy about you 
  [E]I can't live without you 
  [F#m]You don't see it but you're [D]beautiful to me 
   
  (Chorus) (Chorus) 
  Come on 
   
  Outro: 
  [D]Love, open your [E]heart and let it [F#m]go 
  You're so [D]amazing. Don't you [A]know? 
  I don't care [E]what you see 
  You're [F#m]beautiful to [D]me (You're beautiful to me) [A]
