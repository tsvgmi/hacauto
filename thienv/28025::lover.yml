  Intro: 
  [G] [D] [C] [C] 
:lyric: |-
  Verse 1: 
  [G] We can leave the [D]Christmas light up till[C] January 
  [G] And this is our [D]place, we made the [C]rules 
  And there's a [C]dazzling haze 
  A [D]mysterious way [C]about you, dear 
  [G] Have I known you twenty [D]seconds or twenty [C]years? 
   
  Chorus: 
  Can [G]I go [D]where you [C]go? 
  Can we [G]always [D]be this [C]close forever and ever and [G]ah 
  Take me [D]out and take me [C]home 
  You're [G]my, [D]my, [Em]my, [D]my,[C] lover 
   
  Verse 2: 
  [G] We could let our [D]friends crash [C]in the living room 
  [G] This is our [D]place, we made the [C]call 
  And I'm [G]highly suspicious that [D]everyone who sees you [C]wants you 
  I've [G]loved you three summers now, [D]honey, 
  But I [C]want them all 
   
  Chorus: 
  Can [G]I go [D]where you [C]go? 
  Can we [G]always [D]be this [C]close forever and ever and [G]ah 
  Take me [D]out and take me [C]home (forever and ever) 
  You're [G]my, [D]my, [Em]my, [D]my,[C] lover 
   
  Bridge: 
  [G]Ladies and gentlemen, 
  [D]Will you please stand? 
  [Em]With every guitar string [F]scar on my hand 
  [C]I take this magnetic [G]force of a man to be [Am]my [D]lover 
  [G]My heart's been borrowed and [D]yours has been blue 
  [Em]All's well that ends well to [F]end up with you 
  [C]Swear to be [G]overdramatic and true to [Am]my [D]lover 
  And [G]you'll save all your [F]dirtiest jokes [C]for me 
  And at every [Am]table I'll save you a [D]seat, lover 
   
  Chorus: 
  Can [G]I go [D]where you [C]go? 
  Can we [G]always [D]be this [C]close forever and ever and [G]ah 
  Take me [D]out and take me [C]home (forever and ever) 
  You're [G]my, [D]my, [Em]my, [D]my [C] 
  Oh, you're [G]my, [D]my, [Em]my, [D]my [C] 
  Darling you're [G]my, [D]my, [Em]my, [D]my [C]lover
