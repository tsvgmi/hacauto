:lyric: "Capo 1 \n[C]No New Year's Day to celebrate \nNo chocolate covered candy hearts
  to give a[Dm]way [Dmmaj7 \r] \nNo first of [Dm]spring [Dmmaj7 \r] \nNo song to sing
  [Dm7 Dmmaj7\r] \nIn fact here's [Dm]just another [G]ordinary [C]day \n. \n[C]No
  April rain \nNo flowers bloom \nNo wedding Saturday within the month of [Dm]June
  [Dmmaj7\r] \nBut what it [Dm]is [Dmmaj7], is something [Dm7]true [Dmmaj7 \r] \nMade
  up of these [Dm]three words that [G]I must say to [C]you \n. \n(Chorus).  I just
  [Dm7]called to [G]say I love [C]you \nI just [Dm7]called to [G]say how much I [Am]care \nI
  just [Dm7]called to [G]say I [Am7]love you \nAnd I [Dm7]mean it from the [G7]bottom
  of my [C]heart \n. \nNo summer's [C]high \nNo warm July \nNo harvest moon to light
  one tender August [Dm]night [Dmmaj7\r] \nNo autumn [Dm]breeze [Dmmaj7\r] \nNo falling
  [Dm7]leaves [Dmmaj7\r] \nNot even [Dm]time for birds to [G]fly to southern [C]skies \n \nNo
  Libra [C]sun \nNo Halloween \nNo giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you [Dm]bring
  [Dmmaj7\r] \nBut what it [Dm]is [Dmmaj7], though old so [Dm7]new [Dmmaj7\r] \nTo
  fill your [Dm]heart like no three [G]words could ever [C]do \n \n(Len 1/2 tone [C]=>[C#])(Chorus) \n(Len
  1/2 tone [C#]=>[D])(Chorus) \n[Bb]of my [C]heart, of my [D]heart "
