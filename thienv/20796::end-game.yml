  Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future 
  I wanna be your [Fmaj7]end game 
  I wanna be your [C]first string [G] 
  I wanna be your [Dm7]A-Team (whoa, whoa, whoa) 
  I wanna be your [C]end game, end game 
   
  Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future 
  [Dm]Big reputation, big reputation 
  [Am7]Ooh, you and me, we got [G]big reputations, [Dm]ah 
  And you heard about me, [C]ooh 
  I got some [G]big enemies (yeah) 
  [Dm]Big reputation, big reputation 
  [Am7]Ooh, you and me would be a [G]big conversation, [Dm]ah (git, git) 
  And I heard about you, [C]ooh (yeah) 
  You like the [C/G]bad ones, too 
   
  Verse 1: Future 
  You so [Dm]dope, don't overdose 
  I’m so stoked, I need a toast 
  We do the [Am7]most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a [G]boat 
  I got a [Dm]reputation, girl that don't precede me (yeah) 
  I'm one [C]call away whenever you [G]need me (yeah) 
  I'm in a [Dm]G5 (yeah), come to the A-Side (yeah) 
  I got a [Am7]bad boy persona, that's what they [G]like (what they like) 
  You love it, [Dm]I love it, too 'cause you my type (you my type) 
  You [Am7]hold me down, and I protect you with my life 
   
  Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future 
  I don't wanna [Fmaj7]touch you, I don't wanna be 
  Just another [C/E]ex-love, you don’t wanna see 
  I don’t wanna [Dm7]miss you (I don't wanna miss you) 
  Like the other girls do 
  [C/E]I don’t wanna [Fmaj7]hurt you, I just wanna be 
  Drinking on a [C/E]beach with you all over me 
  I know what they [Dm]all say (I know what they all say) 
  But I ain't tryna play 
   
  (Chorus: Taylor Swift) 
   
  Verse 2: Ed Sheeran 
  Knew her when I was [Dm]young 
  Reconnected when we were little bit older, both [Am7]sprung 
  I got issues and chips [G]on both of my shoulders 
  [Dm]Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep 
  The [C]truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me 
  Even [Dm]when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long 
  And you under[Am7]stand the good and bad end [G]up in the song 
  For all your [Dm]beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease 
  For all my [C]flaws, paranoia, and insecurities 
  I've made [Dm]mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny 
  After the [Am7]storm, something was [G]born on the 4th of July 
  I've passed [Dm]days without fun, this end game is the one 
  With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it 
   
  (Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift) 
  (Chorus: Taylor Swift) 
  (Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future) 
   
  Verse 3: Taylor Swift 
  I hit you like bang, we [Dm]tried to forget it, but we just couldn't 
  And [Am7]I bury hatchets, but I keep [G]maps of where I put 'em 
  [Dm]Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy 
  [C]I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me 
  And I [Dm]can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul 
  It's like your [Am7]eyes are liquor, it's like your [G]body is gold 
  You've been [Dm]calling my bluff on all my usual tricks 
  So here's the truth from my red lips 
   
  (Chorus: Taylor Swift, Future, & Ed Sheeran)
