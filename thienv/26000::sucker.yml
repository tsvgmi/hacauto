  We go [Am]together [C] [G] 
  Better than birds of a [Am]feather, you [C]and [G]me [E]

  I'm feeling heat in [Am]December when you're [C]'round [G]me 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  I've been [Am]dancing on top of [C]cars and [G]stumbling out of bars 
  I [Am]follow you through the [C]dark, can't [G]get [E]enough [G] 
  You're the [Am]medicine in the [C]pain, the [G]tattoo inside my brain 
  And, [Am]baby, you know it's [C] [G]obvious

  Any [C]road you take you [F]know that you'll find [E]me 
  I am a sucker for [Am]all the [Dm]subliminal [G]things 
  No one [C]knows about [F]you (About you), 'bout [E]you (About you) 
  And you're [Am]making the [Dm]typical me [G] 
  Break my [C]typical [F]rules

  Verse 2: 
  Don't [Am]complicate [C]it... [G]yeah 
  'Cause I know you and you know [Am]everything [C]about [G]me [E] [G] 
  I can't [Am]remember [C] [G] 
  All of the nights I don't [Am]remember when you're [C]'round [G]me
