  Verse1: 
  Standing [C]here [Csus4]on my [C]own [Csus4] 
  Yeah, the [F]first step’s the hardest when you’re [Fsus4]walking into the un[F]known [Fsus4] 
  It’s been [C]dark, [Csus4]and it’s been [C]cold [Csus4] 
  Had my [F]head in the clouds never [Fsus4]knowing what lies down [C]below [Csus4] 
   
  Pre-chorus: 
  Then you [Am]spoke your [C/G]truth with no [F]secrets 
  Told me [Am]use your [C/G]heart while it’s [F]beating 
   
  Chorus: 
  When [Fmaj7]you’re right here beside me, there’s [C]nothing else I need 
  Your [Fmaj7]eyes keep me reminded that [Am]nothing’s [Em]out of [F]reach 
  When [Am]you’re with [Em]me, it [Fm]feels like I’m finally [F]free [C] 
  Feels like I’m finally [F]free [C] 
   
  Verse2: 
  I didn’t [C]know, [Csus4]didn’t know what [C]was real [Csus4] 
  Had to [F]go to the edge and the [Fsus4]ground just to see how it [F]feels [Fsus4] 
   
  (Pre-chorus) 
  (Chorus) 
   
  Bridge: 
  I [Am]used to spend the [Em]nights [Fmaj7]looking at the stars 
  [Am]Wondering how to get [Em]there, is it [Fmaj7]just too far? 
  I [Am]used to spend the [Em]nights [Fmaj7]looking at the stars 
  [Am]Wondering how to get [Em]there, is it [Fmaj7]just too far? 
   
  Chorus: 
  But when you’re [Fmaj7]right here beside me there’s [C]nothing else I need 
  Yeah, your [Fmaj7]eyes keep me reminded that [Am]nothing’s [Em]out of [F]reach 
  It’s [Am]easy [Em]to be[F]lieve 
  When [Am]you’re with [Em]me it [Fm]feels like I’m finally [F]free 
  Oh [C]yeah 
  It feels like I’m finally [F]free 
  [C](Wo woo) 
  It feels like I’m finally [C]free
