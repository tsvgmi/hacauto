  INTRO: 
  [G] [C] [D] [Dsus4] [D] [Dsus2] [D](2x) 
:lyric: |-
   
  VERSE 1: 
  [G]Who draws the crowd and [C]plays so loud baby it’s the [D]guitar man [Dsus4] [D] [Dsus2] [D] 
  [G]Who's going to steal the [C]show you know baby its the [D]guitar man [Dsus4] [D] [Dsus2] [D] 
   
  CHORUS I: 
  He can [Em]make you love, he can [C]make you cry 
  He will [Em]bring you down and he'll [A]get you high 
  [Cmaj7]Something keeps him going [Bm7]miles and miles a day 
  to f [Am7]ind another place to [D]play [Dsus4] [D] [Dsus2] [D] 
   
  VERSE 2: 
  [G]Night after night who [C]treats you right baby it’s the [D]guitar ma [Dsus4]n [D] [Dsus2] [D] 
  [G]Who's on the radio [C]you go to listen to the [D]guitar man [Dsus4] [D] [Dsus2] [D] 
   
  CHORUS II: 
  When he [Em]comes to town and you [C]see his face 
  And you [Em]think you might like to [A]take his place 
  [Cmaj7]Something keeps him drifting [Bm7]miles and miles away 
  [Am7]searching for the songs to [D]play 
   
  BRIDGE: 
  Then you [Am]listen to the [Ammaj7]music and you [Am7]like to sing along [D] [Dsus4] [D] 
  You [G]want to get the [D/F#]meaning out of [Em]each and every song 
  And you [Am]find yourself a [Ammaj7]message and some 
  [Am7]words to call your [D]own and [Dsus4]take t [D]hem [E]home [C] 
   
  (Guitar Solo over intro chords) 
   
  CHORUS III: 
  He can [Em]make you love, he can [C]get you high 
  He will [Em]bring you down and he [A]may make you cry 
  [Cmaj7]Something keeps him moving, but [Bm7]no one seems to know [Am7]what it 
  is that makes him [D]go. 
   
  OUTRO: 
  Then the [Am]lights begin to [Ammaj7]flicker and the [Am7]sound is getting dim. [D] [Dsus4] [D] 
  The [G]voice begins to [D/F#]falter and the [Em]crowds are getting thin 
  But he [Am]never seems to [Ammaj7]notice he's just [Am7]got to find 
  [D]another [Dsus4]place [D]to [E]play…... [C]......Fade [E]away…. [C].….got to [E]play…. 
  [C]……..fade [E]away… [C]……….Got to [E]play…… [C]……...Fade [E]away
