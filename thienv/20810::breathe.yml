  Cause [Fmaj7]you only got the [G]moment to own it [Am7]while you're [C]alive 
  [Fmaj7]Taking it [G]all in one [Am7]blink at a [C/G]time 
  [Fmaj7]Just let it be and you [G]will see every[Am7]thing will [C]align

  It's a [Fmaj7]mirror to your heart and [G]baby just [Am7]live [C] 
  Let the [Fmaj7]moment take you and [G]make you [Am7]forget [C]
