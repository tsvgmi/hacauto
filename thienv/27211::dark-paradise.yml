  Verse 1: 
  [Am]All my friends tell me I should move on 
  [Am]I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song 
  [F]Ahhh, [Am]that's how you sang it 
  [Am]Loving you forever, can't be wrong 
  [Am]Even though you're not here, won't move on 
  [F]Ahhh, [Am]that's how we played it 
   
  Pre-chorus: 
  And there's no [F]remedy for memory your [Am]face is 
  Like a melody, [G]it won't leave my [F]head 
  Your soul is [F]haunting me and telling me 
  That [Am]everything is fine 
  But [G]I wish I was dead 
   
  Chorus: 
  [Am]Every time I close my [G]eyes 
  It's [Dm]like a dark [Am]paradise 
  No one [F]compares to you 
  I'm [Am]scared that you won't be [G]waiting on the other side 
   
  [Am]Every time I close my [G]eyes 
  It's [Dm]like a dark [Am]paradise 
  No one [F]compares to you 
  I'm [Am]scared that you won't be [G]waiting on the other side 
   
  Verse 2: 
  [Am]All my friends ask me why I stay strong 
  [Am]Tell 'em when you find true love it lives on 
  [F]Ahhh, [Am]that's why I stay here 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  And there's no [F]remedy for memory your [Am]face is 
  Like a melody, [G]it won't leave my [F]head 
  Your soul is [F]haunting me and telling me 
  That [Am]everything is fine 
  But [G]I wish I was dead 
   
  Chorus: 
  [Am]Every time I close my [G]eyes 
  It's [Dm]like a dark [Am]paradise 
  No one [F]compares to you 
  I'm [Am]scared that you won't be [G]waiting on the other side 
  [Am]Every time I close my [G]eyes 
  It's [Dm]like a dark [Am]paradise 
  No one [F]compares to you 
  But [Am]there's no you, [G]except in my dreams tonight 
   
  Post-Chorus: 
  Oh oh oh [F]oh, ha ha ha [Am]ha 
  I don't wanna [F]wake up from this [Am]tonight 
  Oh oh oh [F]oh, ha ha ha [Am]ha 
  I don't wanna [F]wake up from this [Am]tonight 
   
  Bridge: 
  [F]There's no relief, I see you in my sleep 
  [Am]And everybody's rushing me, but I can feel you touching me 
  [F]There's no release, I feel you in my dreams 
  [Am]Telling me I'm [E]fine 
   
  Chorus: 
  [Am]Every time I close my [G]eyes 
  It's [Dm]like a dark [Am]paradise 
  No one [F]compares to you 
  I'm [Am]scared that you won't be [G]waiting on the other side 
  [Am]Every time I close my [G]eyes 
  It's [Dm]like a dark [Am]paradise 
  No one [F]compares to you 
  But [Am]there's no you, [G]except in my dreams tonight 
   
  Outro: 
  Oh oh oh [F]oh, ha ha ha [Am]ha 
  I don't wanna [F]wake up from this [Am]tonight 
  Oh oh oh [F]oh, ha ha ha [Am]ha 
  I don't wanna [F]wake up from this [Am]tonight
