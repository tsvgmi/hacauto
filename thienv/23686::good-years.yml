  Chorus: 
  I’d rather [Bm]be anywhere, anywhere but [G]here 
  I’d rather [G]be anywhere, anywhere but [D]here 
  I close my [Bm]eyes and see a crowd of [A]a thousand [G]tears 
  I pray to [G]God I didn’t waste all my good [D]years 
  All my good [G]years, all [A]my good [D]years 
   
  1. The [Bm]voices screaming loud as hell [G] 
  We don’t care bout no one else [D] 
  Nothing [Bm]in the world could bring us down [G] 
  Now we’re so high among the stars without a [D]worry 
  And neither [G]one, one of us wants to say we’re [D]sorry 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  2. [Bm]Too much drugs and alcohol [G] 
  What the hell were we fighting for [D] 
  [Bm]Cuz now the whole damn world will know [G] 
  That we're too numb and just too dumb 
  To change the [D]story 
  Neither [G]one, one of us wants to say we’re [D]sorry 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  Need a [G]chance just to breathe, feel [Bm]alive 
  And when the [D]day meets the night show me the [A]light 
  Feel the [G]wind and the fire 
  Hold the [Bm]pain deep inside 
  It’s in my [D]eyes, in my [A]eyes 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  I pray to [G]God I didn’t waste all my good [D]years 
  All my good [G]years, all [A]my good [D]years
