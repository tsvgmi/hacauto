:lyric: |-
  1. I [E]wake up every day like "Hello, beautiful." 
  'Cause [C#m]this world is so crazy and it can bring you down 
  You're too [Amaj7]short, too fat, too skinny 
  Hey, well, [B]excuse me if I think that I'm pretty 
   
  2. So I [E]don't care what you say 'cause I'm original 
  I'm [C#m]learning how to love me from my head down to my toes 
  Let 'em [Amaj7]know, let 'em know if you with me 
  Hey, 'cause I [B]finally found the answer is in me 
   
  Pre-chorus: 
  [G#7]Whoa! My mama, she did [C#m]say 
  Don't you let 'em [F#7]get you down 
  How to learn to [B]love me 
   
  Chorus: 
  That's why I'm talking to the [E]girl in the mirror, whoa, oh 
  Like even if you're [C#m]down, better get up, whoa, oh 
  'Cause every set [A]back's just a set up, whoa, oh 
  For something just a [B]little bit better 
  Oh, I'm talking to the [E]girl in the mirror 
  Girl in the mirror 
  [C#m]Girl in the mirror, girl in the mirror 
  [A]Girl in the mirror, girl in the mirror [B] 
   
  3. [E]Go to sleep at night with a smile on my face 
  'Cause [C#m]I know who I am and I can't ever be replaced 
  So go [Amaj7]ahead, be proud, be different 
  Hey, that's what [B]makes you one out of a million 
   
  (Pre-chorus) (Chorus) 
   
  Silento: 
  [E]Sophia, you did it, you took it to the top 
  You gotta keep going, the grind never stops 
  [C#m]Say you won't do what I won't do 
  Yeah, girl, I'm watching you 
  [Amaj7]You got that swagger, you got that glow 
  For all the doubters, just let them know 
  [B]Count up more, for days just go 
  I love your soul and your rhythm flow 
  [E]Like "Oh, yeah", I'm like "Oh, yeah" 
  Put your hands in the air 
  [C#m]That girl power, that girl power 
  Put your hands up for the girl power 
  [Amaj7]I like it, I won't bite it 
  Keep it on 'cause I'm watching 
  [B]Keep going, just kill it 
  Sophia Grace, you're number one chance 
   
  Sophia Grace: 
  That's why I'm talking to the [E]girl in the mirror, whoa, oh 
  Like even if you're [C#m]down, better get up, whoa, oh 
  'Cause every set [Amaj7]back's just a set up, whoa, oh 
  For something just a [B]little bit better 
  Oh, I'm talking to the [E]girl in the mirror 
  Girl in the mirror 
  [C#m]Girl in the mirror, girl in the mirror 
  [Amaj7]Girl in the mirror, girl in the mir [B]ror 
  [E] [C#m] [Amaj7] [B]
