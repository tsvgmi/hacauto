  Verse 1: 
  [D]How long have you been [A]smiling? 
  It [E]seems like it's been too l[F#m]ong [E] 
  Some [D]days I don't feel like [A]trying 
  So [E]what the fuck are you [F#m]on? [E] 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  [D]I think too much[A], we drink too much [E] 
  Falling in [F#m]love like it's[E]just nothing [D] 
  I want to [A]know where do we go [E] 
  When nothing's [F#m]wrong 
   
  Chorus: 
  [E]'Cause all the kids are [D]depressed 
  Nothing ever [A]makes sense 
  I'm not feeling [E]alright 
  Staying up 'til [F#m]sunrise 
  And [E]hoping shit is [D]okay 
  Pretending we know [A]things 
  I don't know what [E]happened 
  My natural [F#m]reaction is [E]that we're scared [D] [A] [E] 
  [F#m]So I [E]guess we're [D]scared [A] [E] [F#m] [E] 
   
  Verse 2: 
  [D]But I can't really keep [A]lying 
  'Cause [E]I've been scared all [F#m]along [E] 
  Getting[D]sick of sleeping in 
  [A]While all my friends are popping pills 
  [E]And I don't think that they're [F#m]wrong [E] 
   
  (Pre-Chorus) 
  (Chorus) 
   
  Outro: 
  [D]I won't deny it 'cause [A]you stole all the words 
  [E]I can't deny it if [F#m]you won't give a fuck[E] 
  So[D]I'll start it [A]out 
  You know I [E]am so in [F#m]love
