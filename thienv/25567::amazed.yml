  Verse: 
  [G]Everytime our eyes meet, [D]this feeling inside me 
  [Em]Is almost more than I can [C]take 
  [G]Baby when you touch me, I [D]can feel how much you love me 
  [Em]And it just blows me [C]away 
  I'[Bb]ve never been this close to [F]anyone or anything 
  [Gm]I can hear your thoughts, I [Eb]can see your dreams... 
   
  Chorus: 
  [C]I don't know how you do what [G]you do 
  I'm so in love with [Am]you, it just keeps getting [F]better 
  [C]I wanna spend the rest of my l[G]ife with you by my[Am]side 
  Forever and [F]ever 
  [Eb]Every little thing that [F]you do 
  Baby I'm amazed by [G]you. 
   
  Verse: 
  [G]The smell of your skin, [D]the taste of your kiss 
  [Em]The way you whisper in the [C]dark 
  [G]Your hair all around me,[D]baby you surround me 
  [Em]You touch every place in my [C]heart 
  [Bb]Oh, it feels like the firs[F]t time everytime 
  [Gm]I wanna spend the whole night[Eb]in your eyes... 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  [C]Every little thing that [G]you do 
  I'm so in love with [Am]you, it just keeps getting [F]better 
  [C]I wanna spend the rest of my [G]life with you by my[Am]side 
  Forever and [F]ever 
  [Eb]Every little thing that you[F]do 
  Baby I'm amazed by [G]you.
