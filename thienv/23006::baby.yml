  Tone chuan Cm.   Capo 3 choi Am 
  [Dm] [G] [Cmaj7] [Fmaj7] [Dm] [E] 
   
:lyric: |-
  [Am]Sé que te gusto a ti todavía 
  Tres, dos, uno 
   
  [Am]Standing here in an empty room 
  I saw you there and my blood ran cold 
  [Am]Take me back to that long September 
  Don't know how I ever let you go 
   
  [Am]I was young, didn't know 'bout love 
  You were wild, couldn't get enough 
  [Am]Gave my heart to another lover 
  Don't know how I ever let you go 
   
  [Am]Find me, in another [E]place and time 
  If [Am]only, if only [G]you were mine 
  But [C]I'm already [E]someone else's [Fmaj7]baby 
  [G]...Guess I had my last [Dm]chance 
  [G]....And now this is our last [Cmaj7]dance 
  [Fmaj7].....You fell through the cracks in my [Dm]hands 
  Hard to say it's [E]over 
  But [Am]I'm already someone else's 
   
  [Dm]Baby, [G]ahh 
  [Cmaj7]Baby, [Fmaj7]ahh 
  [Dm]Baby, [E]ahh 
  But [Am]I'm already someone else's 
   
  [Am]All caught up in the way we were 
  I feel your hands getting close to mine 
  [Am]Don't say the words that I love to hear 
  The beat goes on and I close my eyes 
   
  [Am]I was young, didn't know 'bout love 
  You were wild, couldn't get enough 
  [Am]Let's leave things the way they were 
  You'll stay with me like a lullaby 
   
  [Am]Hey, sé que te gusto a ti [E]todavía por mucho que digas 
  [Am]Además puedo ver en tus ojos 
  Que [G]no sólo quieres quedar como ami[C]gos 
  Tienes mi corazón, [E]eres mi obsesión 
  [F]...Soy tuyo pa' siempre [G] 
   
  [Am]Guess I had my last [Dm]chance 
  [G]....And now this is our last [Cmaj7]dance 
  [Fmaj7]...You fell through the cracks in my [Bm7b5]hands 
  Tell myself be [E]stronger 
  My [Am]heart's like a [G]rubber [C]band 
  And [Am]it's such a [Dm]shame 
  You'll [G]always be the one who got [Cmaj7]away 
  We [Fmaj7]both know that deep down you feel the [Bm7b5]same 
  Hard to say it's [E]over 
  But [Am]I'm already someone else's (C'mon) 
   
  [Dm]Baby, [G]ahh 
  [Cmaj7]Baby, [Fmaj7]ahh 
  [Dm]Baby, [E]ahh 
  [Am]I'm already someone else's 
   
  [Dm]Wish I met you at another [G]place and time 
  [Cmaj7]If only, if on[Fmaj7]ly you were mine 
  This [Dm]love story ends for you and [E]I 
  'Cause [Am]I'm already someone else's 
  [Dm]Baby, [G]ahh 
  [Cmaj7]Baby, [Fmaj7]ahh 
  [Dm]Baby, [E]ahh 
  But [Am]I'm already someone else's 
   
  [Dm]Baby, [G]ahh 
  [Cmaj7]Baby, [Fmaj7]ahh 
  [Dm]Baby, [E]ahh 
  [Am]I'm already someone else's
