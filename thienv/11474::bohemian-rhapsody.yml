:lyric: "Queen Lyrics \n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" \ntone Randy Coleman: [Bb\r] \n \n[Gm
  ]Is this the real life? \n[C ]Is this just fantasy? \n[F7 ]Caught in a landslide, \n[Bb
  ]No escape from reality. \n \n[Gm ]Open your eyes, \n[Bb7 ]Look up to the skies
  and [Eb ]see, \n[Cm ]I'm just a poor boy, [F ]I need no sympathy, \nBecause [B ]I'm
  easy [Bb ]come, [A ]easy [Bb ]go, \n[B ]Little [Bb ]high, [A ]little [Bb ]low, \n[Eb
  ]Any way the [Bb ]wind blows [Bbdim ]doesn't \nreally [F7 ]matter to me, [Bb6 ]to
  me. \n \n[Bb6 ]Mama, just [Gm9 ]killed a man, \nPut a [Cm ]gun against his head, \nPulled
  my trigger, now he's [F ]dead. \n[Bb6 ]Mama, life had [Gm9 ]just begun, \nBut [Cm7
  ]now I've gone and [Baug]thrown it all [F ]away. \n \n[Eb ]Mama, [Gm7 Cm ]ooh, \nDidn't
  [Ab ]mean to make you cry, \nIf [Bb ]I'm not back [Bb7 ]again this time [Eb ]tomorrow, \nCarry
  [Gm7 ]on, carry [Cm7 ]on as if [Abm7 ]nothing really [Eb ]matters. \n \n[Bb6 ]Too
  late, my [Gm9 ]time has come, \nSends [Cm ]shivers down my spine, \nBody's aching
  all the [F ]time. \n[Bb6 ]Goodbye, everybody, I've [Gm9 ]got to go, \nGotta [Cm7
  ]leave you [Baug]all behind and face the [F ]truth. \n \n[Eb ]Mama, [Gm7 Cm ]ooh
  (any way the wind blows), \nI [Ab6 ]don't wanna die, \nI [Bb ]sometimes [Bb7 ]wish
  I'd never been born at [Eb ]all. \n \n[Gm7 Cm Ab6 Bb Bb\r] \n[Eb Bb Cm Fm7 Bb Bb
  Eb\r] \n \n[Eb ]Mama, [Gm7 Cm ]ooh (any way the wind blows), \nI [Ab6 ]don't wanna
  die, \nI [Bb ]sometimes [Bb7 ]wish I'd never been born at [Ab ]all. [Abm6 Eb\r] \n "
