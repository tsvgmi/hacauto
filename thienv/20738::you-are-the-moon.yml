:lyric: |-
  [Em]Shadows all a[C]round you as you [G]surface from the [Am]dark 
  [Em]Emerging from the [C]gentle grip of [G]night's unfolding [Am]arms 
  [Em]Darkness, darkness [C]everywhere, do [D]you feel [Em]alone? 
  [Em]The subtle grace of [C]gravity, the [G]heavy weight of [Am]stone 
   
  [Em]You don't see what [C]you possess, a [G]beauty calm and [Am]clear 
  [Em]It floods the sky and [C]blurs the darkness [G]like a chande[Am]lier 
  [Em]All the light that [C]you possess is [D]skewed by lakes and [Em]seas 
  [Em]The shattered [C]surface, so imperfect, is [G]all that you [Am]believe 
   
  (Giang Tau) 
   
  [Em]I will bring a [C]mirror, so [G]silver, so e[Am]xact 
  [Em]So precise and [C]so pristine, a [G]perfect pane of [Am]glass 
  [Em]I will set the [C]mirror up to [D]face the blackened [Em]sky 
  [Em]You will see your [C]beauty every [G]moment that you [Am]rise 
  [Em] [G] [Cmaj7] [Cmaj7] [Em] [G] [Cmaj7] [Bm] [Bm] [Em]
