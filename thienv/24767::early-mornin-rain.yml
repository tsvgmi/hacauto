:lyric: |-
  [G]In the early mornin' [Bm]rain, [Am]with a [D7]dollar in my [G]hand, 
  And an achin' in my [Am]heart, [D7]and my pocket's full of [G]sand. 
  [G]I'm a long way from [Am]home, [D7]and I miss my loved one [G]so, 
  In the early mornin' [Bm]rain, [Am] [D7]with no place to [G]go. 
   
  [G]Out on runway number [Bm]nine, [Am] [D7]big 707 set to [G]go. 
  But I'm out here on the [Am]grass, [D7]where the pavement never [G]grows. 
  Well the liquor tasted [Am]good, [D7]and the women all were [G]fast. 
  [G]There she goes my [Bm]friend, [Am] [D7]she's rollin' down at [G]last. 
   
  [G]Hear the mighty engines [Bm]roar, [Am] [D7]see the silver wing on [G]high. 
  [G]She's away and westward [Am]bound, [D7]far above the clouds she [G]flies. 
  [G]Where the mornin' rain don't [Am]fall, [D7]and the sun always [G]shines. 
  [G]She'll be flyin' o'er my [Bm]home, [Am] [D7]in about three hours [G]time. 
   
  [G]This old airport's got me [Bm]down, [Am] [D7]it's no earthly good to [G]me. 
  [G]Cause I'm stuck here on the [Am]ground, [D7]cold and drunk as I might [G]be. 
  [G]Can't jump a jet [Am]plane, [D7]like I can a freight [G]train. 
  [G]So I'd best be on my [Bm]way, [Am] [D7]in the early mornin' [G]rain. 
  [G]So I'd best be on my [Am]way, [D7]in the early mornin' [G]rain.
