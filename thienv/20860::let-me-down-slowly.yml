  Verse 1: 
  [Am]This night is [G]cold in the kingdom

  [Am]From the kitchen to the [G]bathroom sink and 
  Your steps keep me awake 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  Don't [Am]cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste 
  I [Em]once was a man with [F]dignity and grace 
  Now I'm [Am]slipping through the cracks of your [G]cold embrace 
  So [Em]please, please [F] 
   
  Chorus: 
  Could you [Am]find a way to let me down [G]slowly? 
  A little [Em]sympathy, I hope you can [F]show me 
  If you [Am]wanna go then I'll be so [G]lonely 
  If you're [Em]leaving baby let me down [F]slowly 
   
  Let me down, [Am]down 
  Let me down, down 
  [G]Let me down, let me down 
  [Em]Down, let me down, down 
  [F]Let me down 
  If you [Am]wanna go then I'll be so [G]lonely 
  If you're [Em]leaving baby let me down [F]slowly 
   
  Verse 2: 
  Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile 
  [Em]As I'm walking down the [F]corridor 
  And I know we haven't [G]talked in a while 
  [Em]So I'm looking for an [F]open door 
   
  (Pre-Chorus)
