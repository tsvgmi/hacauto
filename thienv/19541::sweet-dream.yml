:lyric: |-
  It’s gonna be another [C]day of bright sun[D]shine 
  Golden sunrays are dancing [Bm]outside my [Em]window 
  When I finally [Am]wake up 
  I’m glad I [D]see you smiling at [G]me gently 
  Your tender [G]kiss rests upon my [Am]cheeks 
  I hear you [D]whisper: “I love [G]you so” 
  I drink my [G]coffee, thinking of [Am]you, 
  Is this true [D]or am I just [G]dreaming? 
   
  It’s gonna be another [C]day of bright sun[D]shine 
  Golden sunrays are dancing [Bm]outside my win[Em]dow 
  When I finally wake [Am]up 
  I’m glad I [D]see you smiling at [G]me gently [G7] 
  When we can be together, [C]I feel para[D]dise 
  There is nothing more fulfilling [Bm]than your sweet [Em]love 
  Our love is unbreaka[Am]ble, it’s true I [D]know, 
  ‘ cause you’re right by [G]my side 
   
  I’m never [G]really fond of my [Am]name 
  Always won[D]der why, it’s such a [G]bore 
  But whene[G]ver you call out [Am]my name, 
  All of my [D]doubt has just gone [G]away 
   
  It’s gonna be another [C]day of bright sun[D]shine 
  I feel shining and beauti[Bm]ful when I’m with [Em]you 
  I feel blessed in your em[Am]brace 
  Because I [D]know that you love me [G]so [G7] 
  When we can be together, [C]I feel para[D]dise 
  You can see I’m living in the [Bm]dream of [Em]mine 
  Your love makes me feel [Am]alive, 
  That’s when my [D]heart feels yours touch and [G]beats again 
   
  Right now I am the [C]happiest person, 
  [D]There’s no one whose [BmEm]dreams (are) sweeter that mine 
  Take my hand, stay [Am]by my side 
  [D]Don’t break it. Don’t [B]tell me it’s a dream 
   
  It’s gonna be another [C]day of bright sun[D]shine 
  Golden sunrays are dancing [Bm]outside my [Em]window 
  When I finally wake [Am]up 
  I’m glad I [D]see you smiling at [G]me gently [G7] 
  When we can be together, [C]I feel para[D]dise 
  There is nothing more fulfilling [Bm]than your sweet [Em]love 
  Our love is unbreaka[Am]ble, it’s true I [D]know, 
  ‘ cause you’re right by my [G]side [G7] 
  When we can be together, [C]I feel para[D]dise 
  There is nothing more fulfilling [Bm]than your sweet [Em]love 
  Our love is unbreaka[Am]ble, it’s true I [D]know, 
  ‘ cause you’re right by my [G]side
