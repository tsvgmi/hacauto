  Verse 1: 
  [Dm]Took you like a [Bb]shot 
  Thought that I could [F]chase you with the cold evening 
  Let a couple [Dm]years water down how I'm [Bb]feeling about 
  [F]you (feeling about you) 
  [Dm]And every time we [Bb]talk 
  Every single [F]word builds up to this moment 
  And I gotta [Dm]convince myself I don’t [Bb]want it, 
  even though I [F]do (even though I do) 
   
  Chorus: 
  [Dm]You could [Bb]break my heart in [F]two 
  But when it heals, it beats for [Dm]you 
  I know its forward but it's [F]true 
  [Dm]I wanna [Bb]hold you [F]when I'm not supposed to 
  [Dm]When I’m lying [Bb]close to [F]someone else 
  You're [Dm]stuck in my [Bb]head and [F]I can't get you out of it 
  If [Dm]I could do it [Bb]all again 
  I know I'd go back to you [Dm] [Bb] [F] [Dm] [Bb] [F] 
  I know I'd go back to you [Dm] [Bb] [F] [Dm] [Bb] [F] 
  I know I'd go back to you 
   
  Verse2: 
  [Dm]We never got it [Bb]right 
  Playing and re [F]playing old conversations 
  Overthinking [Dm]every word and I [Bb]hate it 
  'Cause it's not [F]me (’Cause it’s not me) 
  [Dm]And what's the point in [Bb]hiding 
  And everybody [F]knows we got unfinished business 
  And I re [Dm]gret it if I [Bb]didn’t say this 
  isn't what it [F]could be (isn't what it could [F]be) 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  Bridge: 
  [Dm]You can [Bb]break my heart in [F]two 
  But when it heals, it beats for [Dm]you 
  I know its [Bb]forward but it's [F]true 
  Won't lie, I'd go back to [Dm]you 
  You know, my [Bb]thoughts are running [F]loose 
  It's just a thing you make me do 
  [Dm]And I could [Bb]fight, but what's the [F]use 
  I know I'd go back to [Dm]you 
   
  (Chorus)
