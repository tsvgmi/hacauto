  Intro: 
  [G] 
:lyric: |-
   
  Chorus 1: 
  [G]Maybe it's time to let the old ways die 
  [C]Maybe it's time to let the old ways [G]die 
  [C]It takes a lot to change a man 
  Hell, it[G]takes[D/F#]a lot to[Em]try 
  [D]Maybe it's time to let the[C]old ways [G]die 
   
  Verse 1: 
  [G]Nobody knows what waits for the dead 
  [C]Nobody knows what waits for the [G]dead 
  [C]Some folks just believe in the things they've 
  [G]heard and the[D/F#]things they [Em]read 
  [D]Nobody knows what [C]awaits for the [G]dead 
   
  [C]I'm glad I can't go back to where I came [G]from 
  [C]I'm glad those days are gone, gone for [G]good 
  [C]But If I could take spirits from my [G]past and 
  [D/F#]bring them here[Em]you know I [D]would 
  Know[C]I would 
   
  Verse 2: 
  [G]Nobody speaks to God these days 
  [C]Nobody speaks to God these [G]days 
  [C]I'd like to think he's lookin' down and [G]laughin' [D/F#]at our [Em]ways 
  [D]Nobody speaks to [C]God these [G]days 
   
  [C]When I was a child they tried to fool [G]me 
  [C]Said the worldly man was lost and that a Hell was [G]real 
  [C]But I've seen Hell in Reno 
  And this [G]world's [D/F#]one big old[Em]Catherine [D]wheel 
  [C]Spinning still 
   
  Chorus repeat: 
  [G]Maybe it's time to let the old ways die 
  [C]Maybe it's time to let the old ways [G]die 
  [C]It takes a lot to change your plans 
  And a [G]train to [D/F#]change [Em]your mind 
  [D]Maybe it's time to let the [C]old ways [G]die 
  Ooh[D], Maybe it's time to let the [C]old ways [G]die
