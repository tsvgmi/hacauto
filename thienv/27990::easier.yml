  [Dm]Is it easier to stay? Is it easier [F]to go? 
  I don't wanna [C]know, oh 
  But [Bb]I know that I'm never, ever gonna change 
  And [Gm]you know you don't want it [C]any other way 
   
  Verse 1: 
  [Dm]Why do we always gotta run [F]away? 
  And we wind up in the same [C]place 
  It's like we're looking for the same [Bb]thing 
  Same [Gm]thing, yeah 
   
  [Dm]Yeah, do we really gotta do this [F]now? 
  Right here with all your friends [C]around 
  In the morning, we can work it [Bb]out 
  Work it [Gm]out 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  [Dm]I love you so much that I [F]hate you 
  [C]Right now, it's so hard to [Bb]blame you 
  'Cause you're so damn [Gm]beautiful 
  You're [C]so damn beautiful 
   
  Chorus: 
  [Dm]Is it easier to stay? Is it easier [F]to go?

  Verse 2: 
  [Dm]Every time that you say you're gonna [F]leave 
  That's when you get the very best of [C]me 
  You know we need it like the air we [Bb]breathe 
  Air we [Gm]breathe, yeah 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  [Dm]I love you so much that I [F]hate you (oh)

  'Cause you're so damn [Gm]beautiful (oh) 
  You're [C]so damn beautiful (oh)

  [Dm]Is it easier to stay? Is it easier [F]to go? 
  I don't wanna [C]know, oh 
  But [Bb]I know that I'm never, ever gonna change 
  And [Gm]you know you don't want it [C]any other way 
   
  Bridge: 
  The[F]hardest [C]part of [Bb]all (Da-da-da-dum-da-da) 
  Is that we're [F]only [C]built to [Bb]fall (Is it easier?) [Dm] 
   
  Chorus: 
  [Dm]Is it easier to stay? Is it easier [F]to go?
