  [Em]Anything she need, she can call me 
  Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, dawg that's all me 
  Just know if you cross her, then you cross me 
  Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you 
   
  (It’s Fred [C]again) Anything she need, she can call me 
  Don't [D]worry 'bout her, that's my seed, dawg that's all me

  Cross [D]me, cross me, if you, if 
   
  Verse 1: 
  And she ain't messin' with no [C]other man 
  And me and her have something [D]different 
  I really need all you to [Em]understand

  [C]Kung-pow, get your ass with a cross kick 
  [D]Blowing air out, wear ya out, you exhausted 
  [Em]Know she's gonna slide anytime you bitches talk shit 
  [D]Keep a lil' blade in her fuckin' lip gloss kit 
   
  [C]Ayy, no one say hi to me without [D]her 
  Better pay your respect to the [Em]queen 
  Better do that shit without a [D]flirt 
  Gotta respect the [C]HBIC 
  Couple of things that you need to [D]know 
  If you still wanna be friends with me
