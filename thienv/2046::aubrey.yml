:lyric: "Intro: \n[G D/F# Em D C G/B Am7 D G\r] \n[G]And [D/F#]Aubrey was her [Em]name \n[Gmaj7]A
  not so [C]very ordinary [G/B]girl or [Am7]name \n[D]But who's to [G]blame [D/F#
  Em]for a [B]love that wouldn't [C#m7b5]bloom \n[Cmaj7 ]For the hearts that never
  played [Gmaj7]in tune \n[Am7]Like a lovely [Bm]melody that [C]everyone can [Bm]sing \n[Am7]Take
  a way the [Bm]words that rhyme, it [C]doesn't mean a [C#m7b5]thing [Dsus4 D \r] \n \n[G]And
  [D/F#]Aubrey was her [Em]name \n[Gmaj7]We tripped the [C ]light and danced [G/B
  ]together to the [Am7 ]moon \n[D]But where was [G ]June? [D/F# Em ]No it [B ]never
  came [C#m7b5 ]around \n[Cmaj7 ]If it did, it never made [Cmaj7 ]a sound \n[Am7 ]Maybe
  I was [Bm ]absent or was [C ]listening too [Bm ]fast \n[Am7 ]Catching all the [Bm
  ]words but then the [C ]meaning going [C#m7b5 ]past [G\r] \n \n[B7]And God, I miss
  [Em]the girl \nAnd I'd [G/B]go a thousand times around the [C]world just to be \nCloser
  to [Cm]her than to [G]me \n \n[G D/F# Em D C G/B Am7 D G\r] \n \n[G ]And [D/F# ]Aubrey
  was her [Em ]name \n[Gmaj7]I never [C ]knew her but I [G/B ]loved her just the [Am7
  ]same \n[D]I loved her [G ]name. [D/F# Em ]Wished that [B ]I had found a [C#m7b5
  ]way \n[Cmaj7 ]And the reasons that would make [Gmaj7 ]her stay \n[Am7 ]I have learned
  to [Bm ]lead a life [C ]apart from all the [Bm ]rest \n[Am7 ]If I can't have the
  one I [Bm ]want, I'll [C ]do without the [C#m7b5 ]best [G\r] \n \n[B7]Oh, how I
  miss [Em ]the girl \nAnd I'd [G/B ]go a million times around the [C ]world just
  to say \nShe had been [Cm ]mine for a [G ]day. \n \n "
