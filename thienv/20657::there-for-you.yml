:lyric: |-
  [Dmaj7]I woke up pissed off today [Bm] 
  And [F#m7]lately everyone feels fake [E] 
  Some [D]where I lost a piece of me [Bm] 
  Smoking [F#m]cigarettes on balconies [E] 
  But I [Dmaj7]can't do this alone 
  Sometimes [Bm]I just need a light 
  If [F#m7]I call you on the phone 
  Need you on the other side 
   
  Chorus: 
  So when your [Dmaj7]tears roll down your [Bm]pillow like a river 
  I'll be [F#m7]there for you 
  I'll be [E]there for you 
  When you're [Dmaj7]screaming, but they [Bm]only hear you whisper 
  I'll be [F#m7]loud for you 
  But you gotta be there for me too 
  ( [Dmaj7] [Bm] [F#m7] [E]) x 2 
   
  But you gotta be there for me too 
   
  [Dmaj7]Last year took a toll on me [Bm] 
  But I [F#m7]made it with you next to me [E] 
  A [Dmaj7]round the world and back again [Bm] 
  I [F#m7]hope you're waiting at the end [E] 
  But I [Dmaj7]can't do this alone 
  Sometimes [Bm]I just need a light 
  If I [F#m7]call you on the phone 
  Need you on the other side 
   
  So when your [Dmaj7]tears roll down your [Bm]pillow like a river 
  I'll be [F#m7]there for you 
  I'll be [E]there for you 
  When you're [Dmaj7]screaming, but they [Bm]only hear you whisper 
  I'll be [F#m7]loud for you 
  I'll be [E]loud for you
