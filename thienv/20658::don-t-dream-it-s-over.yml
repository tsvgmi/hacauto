:lyric: |-
  [C]There is freedom [Am]within, there is freedom [F]without 
  Try to catch the deluge in a paper [Esus4]cup [E] 
  [C]There's a battle ahead[Am], many battles are lost [F] 
  But you'll never see the end of the road 
  While you're [Esus4]traveling with me [E] 
   
  Chorus: 
  [F]Hey now, [G]hey now 
  [C]Don't dream [Am]it's over 
  [F]Hey now, [G]hey now 
  [C]When the world [Am]comes in 
  [F]They come, [G]they come 
  [C]To build a wall [Am]between us 
  [F]We know they won't win [G] 
   
  [C]Now I'm towing my [Am]car, there's a hole in the [F]roof 
  My possessions are causing me suspicion but [Esus4]there's no proof [E] 
  [C]In the paper today [Am]tales of war and of waste 
  [F]But you turn right over to the T.V. [Esus4]page [E] 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  ([C] [Am] [F] [Esus4]-[E]) x 2 
  [F] [C] [F] [C] [F] [C] [Bb] [Bb] 
   
  [C]Now I'm walking [Am]again to the beat of a drum 
  [F]And I'm counting the steps to the door of your [Esus4]heart [E] 
  [C]Only shadows ahead [Am]barely clearing the roof 
  [F]Get to know the feeling of liberation [Esus4]and release [E] 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  [F] [G] [C] [Am] [F] [G] [C] [Am]
