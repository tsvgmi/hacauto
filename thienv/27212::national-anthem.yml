  [D]Money is the anthem 
  [Bm]Of success 
  [F#m]So before we go out 
  What's your address? 
   
  [D]I'm your National Anthem 
  [Bm]God, you're so handsome 
  [F#m]Take me to the Hamptons 
  Bacardi fare on 
   
  [D]He loves to romance them 
  [Bm]Reckless abandon 
  [F#m]Holdin' me for ransom 
  Upper echelon 
   
  [D]He says to "be cool" but 
  [Bm]I don't know how yet 
  [F#m]Wind in my hair 
  Hand on the back of my [D]neck 
  I said, [Bm]"Can we party later on?" 
  He said, [F#m]"Yes, yes" 
   
  [G]Tell me I'm your [Bm]National [A]Anthem 
  Ooh, yeah, baby, bow down 
  Making me so wow, wow 
  [G]Tell me I'm your [Bm]National [A]Anthem 
  Sugar, sugar, how now 
  Take your body down town 
  [G]Red, white, [Bm]blue's in the skies 
  [A]Summer's in the air and 
  Baby, heaven's in your [G]eyes 
  I'm your [Bm]National [A]Anthem 
   
  [D]Money is the reason 
  [Bm]We exist 
  [F#m]Everybody knows it, it's a fact 
  Kiss, kiss 
   
  I sing the [D]National Anthem 
  [Bm]While I'm standing [F#m]over your body 
  Hold you like a python 
  And you [D]can't keep your hands off [Bm]me 
  Or your pants on 
  [F#m]See what you've done to me 
  Give me Chevron 
   
  You [D]said to "be cool" but 
  [Bm]I'm already coolest 
  [F#m]You said to "get real" 
  Don't you know who you're dealing with? 
  [D]Um, do you think you'll buy me [Bm]lots of diamonds? 
  [F#m](Yes, also a gun) 
   
  [G]Tell me I'm your [Bm]National [A]Anthem 
  Ooh, yeah, baby, bow down 
  Making me so wow, wow 
  [G]Tell me I'm your [Bm]National [A]Anthem 
  Sugar, sugar, how now 
  Take your body down town 
  [G]Red, white, [Bm]blue's in the skies 
  [A]Summer's in the air and 
  Baby, heaven's in your [G]eyes 
  I'm your [Bm]National [A]Anthem 
   
  It's a [F#m]love story for the new age 
  For the six [D]page 
  Want a quick sick rampage? 
  [E]Wining and dining 
  Drinking and driving 
  [Bm]Excessive buying 
  Overdosin', dyin' 
  On our [F#m]drugs and our love 
  and our dreams and our rage 
  [D]Blurring the lines between real and the fake 
  [E]Dark and lonely 
  [Bm]I need somebody to hold me 
  [F#m]We will do very well 
  [D]I can tell, I can tell 
  [E]Keep my safe in his bell [Bm]tower, hotel 
   
  [D]Money is the [Bm]anthem of success 
  [F#m]So put on mascara, and your party dress 
   
  I'm your [D]National Anthem 
  [Bm]Boy, put your hands up 
  [F#m]Give me a standing ovation 
  [D]Boy, you have landed 
  [Bm]Babe, in the land of 
  [F#m]Sweetness and danger 
  Queen of Saigon 
   
  [G]Tell me I'm your [Bm]National [A]Anthem 
  Ooh, yeah, baby, bow down 
  Making me so wow, wow 
  [G]Tell me I'm your [Bm]National [A]Anthem 
  Sugar, sugar, how now 
  Take your body down town 
  [G]Red, white, [Bm]blue's in the skies 
  [A]Summer's in the air and 
  Baby, heaven's in your [G]eyes 
  I'm your [Bm]National [A]Anthem 
   
  [G]Money is the anthem 
  [Bm]God, you're so handsome 
  [A]Money is the anthem 
  Of success
