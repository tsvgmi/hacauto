  [G]Silent night, holy night
  [D7]All is calm, [C]all is [G]bright
  [C]Round yon Virgin [G]Mother and Child
  [C]Holy Infant so [G]tender and mild
  [D7]Sleep in heavenly [Em]peace [C#m7b5]
  [G]Sleep in [D7]heavenly [G]peace
   
  [G]Silent night, holy night!
  [D7]Son of God, [C]love's pure [G]light
  [C]Radiant beams from [G]Thy holy face
  [C]With the dawn of re[G]deeming grace
  [D7]Jesus Lord, at Thy [Em]birth [C#m7b5]
  [G]Jesus [D7]Lord, at Thy [G]birth
   
  [G]Silent night, holy night!
  [D7]Shepherds [C]quake at [G]the sight
  [C]Heavenly hosts from [G]heaven above
  [C]Guardian Angels [G]sing Alleluia!
  [D7]Christ, our Saviour is [Em]born [C#m7b5]
  [G]Christ, our [D7]Saviour [G]is born
