  [C6]Chestnuts [Dm7]roasting on an [Em7]open fire [Fmaj7] [Fm7] [Dm7] 
  [C6]Jack Frost [Gm7]nipping [C7]at your [Fmaj7]nose [Bb9] 
  [C6]Yuletide [Bb9]carols being [Am7]sung by a [F#m7]choir [F7] 
  And [Emaj7]folks dressed [Fm7]up like [Bb9]Eski [Ebmaj7]mos... [Dm7]....e [C#9]verybody 
   
  [C6]knows a [Dm7]turkey and some [Em7]mistletoe [Fmaj7] [Fm7] [Dm7] 
  [C6]Help to [Gm7]make the [C7]season [Fmaj7]bright [Bb9] 
  [C6]Tiny [Bb9]tots with their [Am7]eyes all a [F#m7]glow [F7] 
  Will [Em7]find it [Eb9]hard to [Dm7]sleep [C#9]ton [C6]ight 
   
  They know that [Gm7]Santa' [C7]s on his [Fmaj7]way 
  He's loaded [Gm7]lots of toys and [C7]goodies on his [Fmaj7]sleigh 
  And every [Fm7]mother's child [Bb7]is gonna [Ebmaj7]spy 
  To see if [D7]reindeer really know how to [G7]fly 
   
  [C6]And so I'm [Dm7]offering this [Em7]simple [Fmaj7]phrase [Fm7] [Dm7] 
  [C6]To kids [Gm7]from one to [C7]ninety- [Fmaj7]two [Bb9] 
  Al[C6]though it's been [Bb9]said many [Am7]times, many [F#m7]ways [F7] 
  Merry [Em7]Chri[Eb9]stm[Dm7]as [G7]to [C6]you
