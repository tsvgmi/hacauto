  Intro: 
  [Bb] [Bb] [Gm] [Eb] [Bb] 
:lyric: |-
   
  We built [Bb]sandcastles, that washed [Bb]away 
  I made you [Gm]cry,[Eb]when I walked [Bb]away 
  And [F]although I [Bb]promised that I couldn'[Gm]t stay, 
  Every [Eb]promise, don't work out that[Bb]way 
  Every [Eb]promise, don't work out that[Bb]way 
   
  Dishes smashed on my [Bb]counter, from our last [Bb]encounter 
  Pictures snatched out the [Gm]frame 
  Bitch, I scratched out your [Eb]name and your [F]face 
  What is it [Gm]about [Eb]you that I can't [Bb]erase, baby 
  Well, every [Eb]promise, don't work out that[Bb]way 
  Well, every [Eb]promise, don't work out that[Bb]way 
   
  And your heart is [Bb]broken cause I walked [Bb]away 
  Show me your [Gm]scars,[Eb]and I won't walk [Bb]away 
  And [Bb]I know I [Gm]promised that I couldn'[Eb]t stay, [Bb]baby 
  Every [Eb]promise, don't work out that [Bb]way, no..[Gm]. 
  Every [Eb]promis[F]e, don't work out that [Bb]way
