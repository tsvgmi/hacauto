  Verse 1: 
  [Em]Summer nights [C]all align [G] 
  As we [Bm]drown in the moonlight [Em] 
  We [C]collide in plain sight [G] 
  Yeah, I [Bm]know we'll be alright [Em] 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  And we come alive, we [C]run the night with strangers [G] 
  'Cause in the end, we're [Bm]all familiar faces [Em] 
  We're [C]young and wild, enjoy the ride, we made it [G] 
  We made it [Bm] 
   
  Chorus: 
  [Em]I don't need no [C]sleep 
  'Cause I'm already [G]dreaming, already [Bm]dreaming 
  [Em]Say you'll never [C]leave 
  Because I love the [G]feeling, I love the [Bm]feeling 
  Find [Em]myself awake at [C]night 
  See you [G]through my lucid [Bm]eyes 
  Oh, [Em]I don't need no [C]sleep 
  'Cause I'm already [G]dreaming, already [Bm]dreaming 
   
  Post-Chorus: 
  [Em]I don't need no [C]sleep 
  'Cause I'm already [G]dreaming, already [Bm]dreaming 
   
  Verse 2: 
  [Em]Wide awake, [C]no time to waste [G] 
  Make a [Bm]mark on my timeline 
  [Em]We're safe and sound, [C]we come around [G] 
  We are [Bm]dancing, the sun down [Em] 
   
  (Pre-Chorus) 
  (Chorus) 
  (Post-Chorus) 
   
  Outro: 
  Oh, [Em]I don't need no [C]sleep 
  'Cause I'm already [G]dreaming, already [Bm]dreaming
