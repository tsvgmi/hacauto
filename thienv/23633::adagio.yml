  Verse: 
  [Am]I don't know where [Bdim]to find you 
  [Bdim]I don't know how to [Am/C]reach you

  [F/A]Within my heart and [Bdim]my soul 
  [Am/C]I wait for [Dm]you 
  [Esus4]Adagi[E]o 
   
  [Am]All of these nights [Bdim]without you 
  [Bdim]All of my dreams sur[Am/C]round you 
  [Am]I see and I touch your[Dm]face 
  [G/B]I fall into your emb[C]race 
  [F/A]When the time is [Bdim]right I know 
  You'll be [Am/C]in my [Dm]arms 
  [Esus4]Adagi[E]o

  I close my eyes and[C#dim]I find a way 
  No need for me [Dm]to pray 
  I've walked [C]so far

  Nothing [Am]more to explain 
  I know all that [Esus4]remains 
  Is a piano that [Am]plays
