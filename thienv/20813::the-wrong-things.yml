:lnote: Tone [A] 
:lyric: |-
   
  Though it [Dmaj7]wasn't meant to be 
  But all the words you said to me are still [A]so clear 
  Sometimes my [Dmaj7]mind plays tricks on me 
  And I pretend that I can see you laying [A]here 
   
  If I'm sup [Dmaj7]posed to heal in time 
  Should you still be on my mind like [F#m]you are 
  'Cuz I've been [Dmaj7]living with the fear 
  That this pain won't disappear from [Bm7]my heart 
   
  Chorus: 
  Sometimes the [F#m]wrong things [Dmaj7]feel so [A]right 
  Sometimes the [F#m]lights shine [Dmaj7]brighter at [A]night 
  Sometimes the [F#m]truth's [Dmaj7]a [A]lie 
  So when you [C#m]ask me how I [C#7]am I say [F#m]fine 
  So when you [Dmaj7]ask me how I [E]am I say [A]fine 
   
  It's [Dmaj7]impossible to quit 
  When every thought of you's a hit that keeps me [A]high 
  All the [Dmaj7]memories make me numb 
  But they're barely just enough to get me [A]by 
   
  You know I [Dmaj7]wonder all the time 
  If I occupy your mind at [F#m]all 
  I'm em [Dmaj7]barrassed to confess 
  I'm not strong enough [Bm7]to let you go 
   
  (Chorus) 
  So when you [Dmaj7]ask me how I [E]am I say [Bm7]fine [Dmaj7] [Bm7] [Dmaj7] 
   
  Bridge: 
  I'm em [F#m]barrassed to confess 
  I'm not [Dmaj7]strong enough to let you go 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  Won't you [C#m]please [C#7]ask me how I [F#m]am 
  So I would [Dmaj7]like [E]to say I'm [F#m]fine.
