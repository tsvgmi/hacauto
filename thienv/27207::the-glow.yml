  Verse: 
  [D]When you [A]feel like you're [G]ready to go 
  [D]Somewhere [A]you've never [G]been 
  [Bm]Make a [A]wish and the [G]dream in you grows 
  [Em]Shinning as bright as [G]day 
  [Em]Carrying you far [A]away 
   
  Chorus: 
  The [G]story [D]begins with the [A]light in your[Bm]heart 
  A [G]fantasy, a [D]dream, and a [A]spark 
  [Bm]Once you [G]believe you are [A]ready to [D]shine 
  The [C]princess inside you will [A]show 
  You are the [GDA]glow, you are the [GDA]glow 
   
  Verse: 
  [D]Look [A]around, take in [G]all that you see 
  [D]You just [A]might be [G]surprised 
  A [Bm]world of [A]enchantment and [G]pure majesty 
  [Em]You'll be [G]discovering 
  The [G]princess that you're meant to [A]be 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  Verse: 
  [G]Feel [D]your [A]strength, you can [Em]face the world 
  [G]Believe [D]every [A]day, everything is [Em]possible 
  A [G]magical journey awaits [A] 
   
  (Chorus)
