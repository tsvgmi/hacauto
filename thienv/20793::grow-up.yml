  [G]I thought about you the other day 
  [Bm]What the hell happened with you and me? 
  'Cause, [C]oh, ain't no lovin' no [D]more 
  [G]You ain't as cool as you used to be 
  [Bm]Closer to the mirror than you are to me 
  I said, [C]oh, had to show you that [D]door 
   
  Someday I [Em]hope we can fix it, 'cause I [D]ain't too proud to [G]try [C] [D] 
  Say [Em]hi to your friends, and if they ever [D]ask you [C]why 
  We don't talk 
   
  Chorus: 
  [G]Know you gotta grow up 
  Ain't you [Bm]sick of being immature? 
  Talkin' [Em]loud 'cause you insecure 
  You always turn it [C]up, turn it up, turn it up, c'mon 
  Why you [G]always gotta show off? 
  You're so [Bm]offended, I already know 
  But when you [Em]hear this on the radio 
  You're gonna turn it [C]up, turn it up, turn it up 
  'Cause it's all about [G]you-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-[Bm]oh-oh-oh 
  It's all about [Em]you-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-[C]oh-oh 
   
  Now [G]you said some stuff that you can't take back 
  [Bm]How did you think that I would react? 
  'Cause [C]you're, you must be out of your [D]mind, no [C] 
  [G]How did we go straight from love to hate? 
  [Bm]Now it's so deep that we can't be mates 
  I said, [C]oh, we should give it some [D]time 
   
  Someday I [Em]hope we can fix it, 'cause I [D]ain't too proud to [G]try [C] [D] 
  Say [Em]hi to your friends, and [D]if they ever ask you [C]why 
  We don't talk 
   
  Chorus: 
  [G]Know you gotta grow up 
  Ain't you [Bm]sick of being immature? 
  Talkin' [Em]loud 'cause you insecure 
  You always turn it [C]up, turn it up, turn it up, c'mon 
  Why you [G]always gotta show off? 
  You're so [Bm]offended, I already know 
  But when you [Em]hear this on the radio 
  You're gonna turn it [C]up, turn it up, turn it up 
  'Cause it's all about [G]you-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-[Bm]oh-oh 
  It's all about [Em]you-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-[Eb]oh-oh [F] 
  [G]Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh [Bm] [Em] 
  Anytime you start it [C] 
  You're growing up a little, darlin' 
  [G]Oh-oh-oh-oh-[Bm]oh [Em] 
  Anytime you start it [C] 
  You're growing up a little darlin' 
   
  Chorus: 
  [G]Know you gotta grow up (know you gotta grow up) 
  Ain't you [Bm]sick of being immature? (ain't you sick of being immature?) 
  Talkin' [Em]loud 'cause you insecure 
  You always turn it [C]up, turn it up, turn it up, c'mon 
  Why you [G]always gotta show off? (why you always gotta show off?) 
  You're so [Bm]offended, I already know (you're so offended, I already know) 
  But when you [Em]hear this on the radio 
  You're gonna turn it [C]up, turn it up, turn it up 
  'Cause it's all about [G]you-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-[Bm]oh-oh 
  It's all about [Em]you-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-[C]oh-oh (anytime you start it) 
  (You're growing up a little darlin') 'cause it's all 
  about [G]you-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-[Bm]oh-oh 
  It's all about [Em]you-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-[Eb]oh-oh (anytime you start it) 
  You're growing up a [F]little darlin' [G]
