:lyric: |-
  If you [G]need someone to take your hand 
  I'd [Em7]gladly be the one to stay right 
  [Bm]here, right [C]now. [D] 
  When [G]everything starts turning bad 
  [Em7]I'd take the time to let you know it's [Bm]true 
  It's [C]you... [D] 
   
  [Am]Woo~ 
  The [G/B]reason i [C]live is [D]you. 
  [Bm]Woo~ [Em]whatever they [Am]say 
  I'll say it [G/D]now 
   
  Chorus: 
  It's always been [G]you 
  I'm so in love with [Em]you 
  I'd always give it [Bm]all you know 
  There's [C]no one else 
  Just [D]only [G]you 
  The one and only [Em]you 
  I'd tell the world a [Bm]million times 
  You [C]are... the apple [D]of my [G]eye. 
   
  2. When [G]everyone starts passing by 
  I [Em7]hope that you can see that i've been [Bm]here. 
  For [C]you... [D] 
  When [G]everything starts turning bad 
  [Em7]I'd take the time to make things turn a[Bm]round. 
  For [C]you. 
   
  [D]Ah~ [Am] 
  The [G/B]reason i [C]live is [D]you. 
  [Bm]Ah~ [Em] 
  whatever they [Am]say 
  I'll say it [G/D]now 
   
  (Chorus) (Chorus)
