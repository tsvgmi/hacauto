  just [Gm ]won't let go \nDay after [C ]day I'm still holdin' on \n[C ]Even though
  you're gone \n \n2. [F ]Ti amo, wasn't I [Dm ]good to you? \nI did all that [Gm
  ]I could do \nTo make you [C ]want to be here with me \n[C ]I thought you loved
  me \n \n3. I [F ]can't believe \nYou could just [Dm ]turn and leave \nDid it so
  [Gm ]easily \nYou pulled my [C ]world out from under me \nLook what you've done
  to me \n \n4. [F ]How could you end it this way \n[Dm ]After the love that we made? \n[Gm
  ]God, how I wish you had stayed \n[C ]Can't you see that I just want you back? \n \n5.
  [F ]Ti amo, I never [Dm ]had a clue \nThat I was [Gm ]losin' you \nYou never [C
  ]once let me know \nYou were lettin' me go \n \n6. Oh, I [F ]guess it was there
  in your eyes \n[Dm ]Guess it was there in your sighs \n[Gm ]Guess it was there in
  your lies \n[C ]I was blind then, couldn't face the end \n \n7. [F ]Ti amo, thought
  we'd go [Dm ]on and on \nThought we had [Gm ]something strong \nYou pulled my [C
  ]world out from under me \nLook what you've done to me \n \n(4) (1) (6) (7) (4)
  (2) (3) \n \n[F ]Ti amo, I [Dm ]love you so \nMy heart just [Gm ]won't let go \nDay
