  tone [A] 
  [F#m] [D] [A] [E](x2) 
:lyric: |-
  Verse 1: 
  [F#m]Wrapped up, [D]so consumed by 
  [A]All this [E]hurt 
  [F#m]If you [D]ask me, don't 
  [A]Know where to [E]start 
  [F#m]Anger, [D]love, confusion 
  [A]Roads that go no [E]where 
  [F#m]I know there's somewhere [D]better 
  'Cause you [A]always take me [E]there 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  [Bm7]Came to you with a broken faith 
  [F#m]Gave me more than a hand to hold 
  [A]Caught before I hit the ground 
  [Esus4]Tell me I'm safe, you've got me now 
   
  Chorus: 
  [A]Would you take the wheel [Bm7] 
  If I lose control? [F#m] 
  If I'm lyin' [D]here 
  Will you take me [A]home? 
  Could you take [Bm7]care 
  Of a broken [F#m]soul? 
  Will you hold me [D]now? 
  Oh, will you take me [A]home? 
  Oh, will you take me [Bm7]home? 
  Oh, will you take me [F#m]home? 
  Oh, will you take me [D]home? 
  Oh, will you take me [A]home? 
   
  Verse 2: 
  [F#m]Hold the [D]gun to my head 
  [A]Count 1, 2, [E]3 
  [F#m]If it helps me [D]walk away, then [A]it's 
  What I [E]need 
  [F#m]Every minute gets [D]easier 
  The more you [A]talk to [E]me 
  [F#m]You rationalize my [D]darkest thoughts 
  [A]Yeah you, set them [E]free 
   
  (Pre-Chorus) 
  (Chorus) 
   
  Bridge: 
  You say [F#m]space will make it better 
  And [D]time will make it heal 
  I [A]won't be lost forever 
  And [E]soon I wouldn't feel 
  Like I'm [F#m]haun [D]ted, woah [A]fal [E]ling 
  You say [F#m]space will make it better 
  And [D]time will make it heal 
  I [A]won't be lost forever 
  And [E]soon I wouldn't feel 
  Like I'm [F#m]haun [D]ted, woah [A]fal [E]ling 
  You say [F#m]space will make it better 
  And [D]time will make it heal 
  I [A]won't be lost forever 
  And [E]soon I wouldn't feel 
  Like I'm [F#m]haun [D]ted, woah [A]fal [E]ling 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  Home 
  [Bm7]Oh, will you [F#m]take me home? 
  [D]Oh, will you take me [A]home?
