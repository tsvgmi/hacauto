  1. [D6]Day after day alone on a [G]hill the 
  man with [D6]the fool grin is keeping per [Em7]fectly still, But 
  nobody [Em]wants to k now [A]him, they can [D]see that he's just a [Bm7]fool and 
  he [Em7]never shows his [A]feelings 
   
  (Chorus) But the [Dm]fool on the fool on the hill, 
  sees the [Bb]sun going [Gm]down and the 
  [C]eyes in his head see [Dm]the world spinning [D6]round 
   
  2. [D6]Well  on the way [G]head in a cloud, the 
  [D6]man of thousand voices talking perfectly [Em7]loud, But 
  [Em]nobody ever hears [A]him, or the [D]sound he appears to [Bm7]make and 
  he [Em7]never seems to [A]notice. but the [Dm]fool on the fool on the hill 
  (Chorus) 
   
  3. [D6]Day after day alone on a [G]hill the 
  [D6]man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly [Em7]still, And 
  [Em]nobody seems to like [A]him, they can [D]tell what he wants to [Bm7]do and 
  he [Em7]never shows his feelings. 
  (Chorus) 
   
  4. [D6]Day after day alone on a [G]hill the 
  [D6]man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly [Em7]still. 
  [Em]He never listens to [A]them he [D]knows that they're [Bm7]fools 
  ________They don't [A]like him.
