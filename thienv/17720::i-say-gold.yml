:lyric: |-
  1. [Dm ]Walking through the [Am]streets 
  [Bb ]Sometime there's anh [C ]stranger in my [Dm ]town [Am Bb C] 
  Wait ‘til [Dm]april and i [Am]meet 
  [Bb ]Wear my [C ]silken shirts and [Dm ]gowns. [Am Bb C] 
   
  [Gm ]Karaoke i sing 
  Balance [Dm ]my yang with my ying 
  When I [Bb ]say I love to follow eastern [C ]winds. 
   
  Chorus: 
  You think [F ]yellow, I say [C ]gold 
  It's the [Gm ]color of my real [Bb ]skin 
  I am [F ]young but I am [C ]told 
  That my [Gm ]history flows [Bb ]within. 
   
  You think [F ]yellow, I say [C ]gold 
  Feel the [Gm ]current of red [Bb ]river 
  Through my [Dm ]soul 
  You think [C ]yellow, I say [Dm ]gold. 
   
  2. Draw my [Dm ]thoughts in china [Am]ink 
  [Bb ]On my [C ]paper made of [Dm ]rice [Am Bb C] 
  I am [Dm]shy in the [Am]begin 
  [Bb ]When anh [C ]boy gives me the [Dm ]eye. [Am Bb C] 
   
  [Gm ]Karaoke i sing 
  Balance [Dm ]my yang with my ying 
  When I [Gm ]say I love to follow eastern [C ]winds. 
   
  Bridge: 
  Oh red river take me [Dm ]home 
  Feel the current through my [Dm ]soul.
