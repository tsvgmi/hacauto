  Intro: 
  [Gm]Baby, take my hand

  'Cause [Am7]you're my Iron Man 
  And I [D7]love you 3000 
  [Gm]Baby, take a chance 
  'Cause [C7]I want this to be something 
  [Am7]Straight out of a Hollywood [D7]movie 
   
  Verse 1: 
  I [Gm]see you standing there 
  In [C7]your hulk outerwear 
  And [Am7]all I can think 
  Is [D7]where is the ring 
  [Gm]'Cause I know you wanna ask 
  [C7]Scared the moment will pass 
  I [Am7]can see it in your eyes 
  Just [D7]take me by surprise 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  And [Gm]all my friends they tell [C7]me they see 
  You [Am]planning to get [D7]on one knee

  Verse 2: 
  Now [Gm]we're having dinner 
  And [C7]baby you're my winner 
  I [Am7]see the way you smile

  And [Am7]before you could ask

  I [Am7]figured out all the clues 
  So [D7]now I ask
