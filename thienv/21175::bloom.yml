  Verse1: 
  Take a trip into my garden 
  I've got so much to show ya 
  The fountains and the waters 
  Are begging just to know ya 
  And it's [Em7]true, baby [Fmaj7] 
  I've been saving this for [Am7]you, baby [G] 
   
  Verse2: 
  I guess it's [Em7]something like a fun [Fmaj7]fair 
  Put gas into the motor 
  And [Am7]boy I'll meet you right there 
  We'll [G]ride the rollercoaster 
  'Cause it's [Em7]true, [Fmaj7]baby 
  I've been saving this for [Am7]you, [G]baby 
   
  Pre-chorus: 
  I need you [Fmaj7]to 
  Tell me right before it goes down 
  [Am7]Promise me [G]you'll 
  Hold my hand if I get scared now 
  [Em7]Might tell you [Fmaj7]to 
  Take a second, baby, slow it down [Em7] 
  [G]You should know I, you should know I

  (Yeah I [Em7]bloom) I [Fmaj7]bloom just for you 
  (I [Am7]bloom) just [G]for you 
  (Yeah I [Em7]bloom) I [Fmaj7]bloom just for you 
  (I [Am7]bloom) just [G]for you 
  Come on, [Em7]baby, play me like a love [Fmaj7]song 
  Every time it comes on 
  [Am7]I get this [G]sweet desire 
  (Yeah I [Em7]bloom) I [Fmaj7]bloom just for you 
  (I [Am7]bloom) just [G]for you 
   
  Verse3: 
  [Em7]Now it's the perfect season 
  [Fmaj7]Yeah, let's go for it this time 
  [Am7]We're dancing with the trees and 
  [G]I've waited my whole life 
  It's [Em7]true, [Fmaj7]baby 
  I've been saving this for [Am7]you, [G]baby 
   
  (Pre-chorus)

  [Fmaj7]Baby, baby, I've been saving this 
  [Am7]for [G]you, baby 
  Baby, baby, I've been saving this for you, baby
