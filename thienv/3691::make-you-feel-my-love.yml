  Tone Shane Filan is F#. Capo 4 play D 
  [D] [A/C#] [Am/C] [G/B] [Gm/Bb] [D/A] [E7]-[A] [D] 
:lyric: |-
  [D]When the rain is blowing in your [A/C#]face 
  [Am/C]And the whole world is on [G/B]your case 
  [Gm/Bb]I would offer you a warm [D/A]embrace 
  [E7]To make you feel [A7]my love. [D] 
   
  [D]When evening shadows and the stars appear [A/C#] 
  [Am/C]And there is no one there to [G/B]dry your tears 
  [Gm/Bb]I could hold you for a [D/A]million years 
  [E7]To make you feel [A7]my love. [D] 
   
  BRIDGE 1: 
  [G]I know you haven't made your mind up [D]yet 
  [F#7]But I would never [G]do you wrong. [D] 
  [G]I've known it from the moment that [D]we met 
  [Em]No doubt in my mind where you belong [A7] 
   
  VERSE 3: 
  [D]I'd go hungry, I'd go black [A/C#]and blue 
  [Am/C]I'd go crawling down the avenue. [G/B] 
  [Gm/Bb]There's nothing that I [D/A]wouldn't do 
  [E7]To make you feel [A7]my love. [D] 
   
  (INSTRUMENTAL) 
   
  [G]The storms are raging on the [D]rollin' sea. 
  [F#7]And on the highway [G]of regret [D] 
  [G]The winds of change are blowing wild [D]and free. 
  [Em]You ain't seen nothing like me yet. [A7] 
   
  VERSE 4: 
  [D]I could make you happy, make your [A/C#]dreams come true. 
  [Am/C]There’s nothing that I would [G/B]not do. 
  [Gm/Bb]Go to the ends of the earth [D/A]for you 
  [E7]To make you [A7]feel my [D]love. 
  [Gm/Bb]There is nothing that I [D/A]would not do. 
  [E7]To make you [A7]feel my [D]love.
