:lyric: |-
   
  Oh oho oh 
  [F]Like a promises I never made 
  [C]Like a sun but never go down 
  [Dm]Like a changing time I never see 
  [Bb]Like you and me like never be 
  [F]Like a sun that shine for nothing 
  [C]Like a man but never giving 
  [Dm]Like a hobbit never been [Bb]broken 
   
  [F]I never cry the same as you 
  [C]I never want to fade the truth 
  [Dm]I never thought the thing will be [Bb]just you and me 
  [F]I never cry the same as you 
  [C]I never want to change the truth 
  [Dm]I never thought the feeling will [Bb]fade so love truth is 
   
  I rather [F]live with broken heart, laying [C]here with broken dream 
  Never [Dm]thought would be a part, but the [Bb]truth have to made 
  I rather [F]live with broken bones and laying [C]here with all my own 
  Holding [Dm]all this memories in time 
  And I [Bb]don’t want to make me cry again 
  [F]No I don’t want to make me cry 
  [C]No I don’t want to make me [Dm]cry [Bb] 
  [F]No I don’t want to make me cry 
  [C]No I don’t want to make me [Dm]cry [Bb] [C] 
   
  [F]Like missing the place of never been 
  [C]Like a crying never come down 
  [Dm]Like a changing time you never see 
  [Bb]Like you and me, like never be free 
  [F]Like a sun that shine for nothing 
  [C]Like a man but never giving 
  [Dm]Like a hobbit never been [Bb]broken 
  [F]I never cry the same as you 
  [C]I never want to fade the truth 
  [Dm]I never thought the thing will be [Bb]just you and me 
  [F]I never cry the same as you 
  [C]I never want to change the truth 
  [Dm]I never thought the feeling will [Bb]fade so love truth is 
  I rather [F]live with broken heart, laying [C]here with broken dream 
  Never [Dm]thought would be a part, but the [Bb]truth have to made 
  I rather [F]live with broken bones and laying [C]here with all my own 
  Holding [Dm]all this memories in time 
  And I [Bb]don’t want to make me cry again 
  [F]No I don’t want to make me cry 
  [C]No I don’t want to make me cry 
  [Dm]No I don’t want to make you cry 
  [C]Make me cry [F]again
