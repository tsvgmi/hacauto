  Intro: 
  [Dm] [Bb] [F] 
:lyric: |-
  Verse 1: 
  I've gotta [Dm]keep the calm [Bb]before the [F]storm 
  I [Dm]don't want less, I [Bb]don't want [F]more 
  Must [Dm]bar the windows [Bb]and the [F]doors 
  To [Dm]keep me safe, to [Bb]keep me [F]warm 
   
  Verse 2: 
  Yeah, my [Dm]life is what I'm [Bb]fighting [F]for 
  Can't [Dm]part the sea, can't [Bb]reach the [F]shore 
  And my [Dm]voice becomes the [Bb]driving [F]force 
  I won't [Dm]let this pull me [Bb]over [F]board 
   
  Chorus: 
  God, keep my [Dm]head above [Bb]water 
  Don't let me [F]drown 
  It gets [C]harder 
  I'll met you [Dm]there at the [Bb]altar 
  As I [F]fall down to my [C]knees 
  Don't let me [Dm]drown, drown, [Bb]drown 
  Don't let me, [F]don't let me, don't let me [C]drown 
   
  Verse 3: 
  So [Dm]pull me up from [Bb]down [F]below 
  Cause I'm [Dm]underneath the [Bb]under [F]tow 
  Come [Dm]dry me off and [Bb]hold me [F]close 
  I [Dm]need you now, I [Bb]need you [F]most 
   
  Chorus: 
  God, keep my [Dm]head above [Bb]water 
  Don't let me [F]drown 
  It gets [C]harder 
  I'll met you [Dm]there at the [Bb]altar 
  As I [F]fall down to my [C]knees 
  Don't let me [Dm]drown, drown, [Bb]drown 
  Don't let me, [F]don't let me, don't let me [C]drown 
  Don't let me [Dm]drown, drown, [Bb]drown 
  (Don't let me, [F]don't let me, don't let me [C]drown) 
  Keep my head above water, above water 
   
  Bridge: 
  And [Bb]I c [C]an't [F]see in the [Dm]stormy [C]weather 
  [Bb]I c [C]an't [F]seem to keep it [Dm]all [C]together 
  And [Bb]I can't [C]swim the [F]ocean like [Dm]this [C]forever 
  And [Bb]I can't [C]breath 
   
  Chorus: 
  God, keep my [Dm]head above [Bb]water 
  I loose my [F]breath 
  At the b [C]ottom 
  Come rescue [Dm]me, I'll be [Bb]waiting 
  I'm too [F]young to fall asl [C]eep 
  God, keep my [Dm]head above [Bb]water 
  Don't let me [F]drown 
  It gets [C]harder 
  I'll met you [Dm]there at the [Bb]altar 
  As I [F]fall down to my [C]knees 
  Don't let me [Dm]dro- [Bb]own 
  Don't let me, [F]don't let me, don't let me [C]drown 
  Don't let me [Dm]dro- [Bb]own 
  (Don't let me, [F]don't let me, don't let me [C]drown) 
  Keep my head above water, above water
