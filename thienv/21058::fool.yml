  [C]I am just a fool to keep on chasing after nothing great 
  [Am]You are just a fool to keep pretending that you're loving me

  Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh oh 
  [G]oh oh oh oh o-oh oh 
   
  [C]Call me on the phone at three, I talk to you while half [G/B]asleep 
  [Am]Complaining 'bout your mother so I take you to the [G]cemetery 
  [F]Rant to me I like the sound, I like your voice, I like your mouth 
  Oh 
  O-[G]oh 
  Mm m m m
