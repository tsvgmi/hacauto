  Intro: 
  [D] [A] [Bm] [G](x2) 
:lyric: |-
  Verse 1: 
  [D]My lungs are black, my [A]heart is [Bm]pure [G] 
  [D]My hands are scarred from [A]nights [Bm]before [G] 
  [D]And my hair is thinnin', [A]falling [Bm]out of all the wrong [G]places 
  [D]I am a little [ABm]insecure [G] 
   
  Verse 2: 
  [D]My eyes are crossed, but [A]they're still [Bm]blue [G] 
  [D]I bite my nails and [A]tell the [Bm]truth [G] 
  [D]I go from thin to [ABm]overweight, day to day it [G]fluctuates 
  [D]My skin is inked, but [A]faded, [Bm]too [G] 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  But[G]she loves me,[D]she loves me 
  [A]Why the [Bm]hell would she [A]love [G]me 
  When she could have [D]anyone [A]else? 
  Oh,[G]you love me,[D]you love me 
  [A]Why the [Bm]hell would you [A]love [G]me 
  'Cause I don't [D]even love [A]myself 
   
  Chorus: 
  [DA]Baby, the [G]best part of [Bm]me [A]is [DA]you [G] 
  And [DA]lately, [G]everything's [BmA]making [D]sense, [A]too 
  Oh, baby, [G]I'm so in [Bm]love [A]with you 
   
  Interlude: 
  [D] [A] [Bm] [G](x2) 
   
  Verse 2: 
  [D]I overthink [A]and still [Bm]forgive [G] 
  [D]I lose my phone and [A]place [Bm]my bits [G] 
  [D]And I never catch the [A]train on [Bm]time, always 30 [G]minutes [D]behind 
  Your worries ain't [A]seen [Bm]nothin' yet [G] 
   
  Pre-Chorus 2: 
  But[G]you love me,[D]you love me 
  [A]Why the [Bm]hell you love me [G]so 
  When you could have [D]anyone [A]else? 
  Yeah,[G]he loves me,[D]he loves me 
  [A]And I bet he [Bm]never [A]lets me [G]go 
  And shows me [D]how to love [A]myself 
   
  Chorus: 
  'Cause, [DA]baby, the [G]best part of [Bm]me [A]is [D]you,[A] [G]woah 
  And [DA]lately, [G]everything's [BmA]making [D]sense, [A]too 
  Baby, [G]I'm so in [Bm]love [A]with you 
   
  Solo:

  Chorus: 
  [DA]Baby, the [G]best part of [Bm]me [A]is [D]you,[A] [G]woah 
  And [DA]lately, [G]everything's [BmA]making [D]sense, [A]too 
  Baby, [G]I'm so in [Bm]love [A]with you[D] [A](Oh) 
  Baby, [G]I'm so in [Bm]love [A]with you[D](Yeah, [A]yeah)
