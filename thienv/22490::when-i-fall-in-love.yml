  Verse 1: 
  [C]When I fall in love, 
  It will be for[G]ever 
  [C]Or I'll never [A7]fall in [Dm7]love.[Bb7] 
  In [Cmaj7]a restless world [Ddim]like this is, 
  [C]Love is ended [Bb6]before it's be[A7]gun; 
  And [Dm]too many moonlight [Aaug]kisses [A7] 
  Seem to [Dm]cool in the [Dm7]warmth [G7]of the sun. 
   
  Verse 2: 
  [C]When I [Ddim]give my [Cmaj7]heart, [Ddim] 
  [Cmaj7]It will [Ddim]be [Bb7]completely [G] 
  [C]Or I'll never [Aaug]give [A7]my [Dm7]heart; [Bb7] 
  [G]And the [C]moment I can [F]feel that 
  [Aaug]You [A7]feel that way, [Dm]too,[Fm6] 
  Is [C]when I fall in [G7]love with [C]you.[Ddim] [C] [Ddim] [C]
