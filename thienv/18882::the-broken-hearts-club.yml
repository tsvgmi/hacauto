  I need [C#m]emotion, Novocaine, I need a [E]numbing of my brain 
  I need [B]somethin' to take away the [A]remains of your name 
  I need [C#m]amnesia for a day and an [E]umbrella for the rain 
  That [B]hasn't gone away since you [A]said you didn't need me 
  Lately been thinkin' [B]maybe 
  There's a [C#m]place we won't feel so [B]crazy 
  Been in a [A]hazy mid-morning [B]daydream 
  I found a [C#m]shady spot that they [B]saved me 
  They said, "come [C#m]be the newest member of the [E]broken hearts club 
  We hate [B]every little thing about the [A]people that we love 
  We're the [C#m]let-down, we're the lied-to, where the [E]lost go and it finds you 
  Where the [B]lonely make the lonely feel less [A]lonely, and we're dyin' to 
  In [C#m]vite you to stay, and [E]take away the pain 
  'Cause [B]misery loves company, so [A]hey, what do you say?" 
  And at [C#m]first I wasn't sure if [E]there's even a cure 
  For what I'm [B]feelin', 'cause what I'm feeling's been feelin' [A]more and more absurd 
  The re [C#m]peating in my head of every [E]last word that you said 
  Feels [B]like ever since you left, you still won't [A]leave me 
  And lately, been thinkin' [B]maybe 
  There might be a [C#m]place we won't feel so [B]crazy 
  For [A]changing the way you [B]made me 
  And in a [C#m]daydream, I let them [B]save me 
   
  [C#m]I'm the newest member of the [E]broken hearts club 
  We hate [B]every little thing about the [A]people that we love 
  We're the [C#m]let-down, we're the lied-to, where the [E]lost go and it finds you 
  Where the [B]lonely make the lonely feel less [A]lonely, and we're dyin' to 
  In [C#m]vite you to stay, and [E]take away the pain 
  'Cause [B]misery loves company, so [A]hey, what do you say? 
  I guess if [C#m]you can't beat 'em, join 'em 
  That's what [Am/C]they always say 
  Let's [E/B]go inside, let's coincide 
  And I'll [A]commensurate 
  Singin', [C#m]we're the newest members of the [E]broken hearts club 
  We still [B]feel pretty lonely and we [A]wish we didn't, but 
  [C#m]We're the newest members of the [E]broken hearts club 
  [B]And we all kinda hate it, but it's [A]easier than love 
  Singin', [C#m]we're the newest members of the [E]broken hearts club 
  And we still [B]feel pretty lonely and we [A]wish we didn't, but 
  [C#m]We're the newest members of the [E]broken hearts club 
  And [B]we all kinda hate it, but it's [A]easier
