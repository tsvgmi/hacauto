  Intro: 
  [C]Hmm, hmm 
:lyric: |-
   
  Verse: 
  Wake [C]up and smell the [F]coffee 
  Is your [C]cup half full or [F]empty? 
  When we [C]talk, you say it [F]softly 
  But I [C]love it when you're awfully [F]quiet[C], hmm[Am], [C] [F]quiet 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  You [C]see a piece of [F]paper 
  Could [C]be a little [F]greater 
  Show [C]me what you could [F]make her 
  You'll [C]never know until you [F]try it[Am] [C] [F] [C] 
  You don't have to [C]keep it [F]quiet[C] 
   
  Chorus: 
  And I [Am]know it [Em]makes you ner-[C]vous 
  But I [Am]promise [Em]you, it's [F]worth it 
  To show [Am]'em every-[Em]thing you kept in-[G]side 
  Don't [C]hide, don't [Em]hide 
  Too [Am]shy to [Em]say, but I [G]hope you stay 
  Don't [Em]hide a-[Am]way 
  Come out and [C]play 
   
  Bridge: 
  Look [C]up, out of your w[F]indow 
  See [C]snow, won't let it [F]in though 
  Leave [C]home, feel the [F]wind blow 
  'Cause it's [C]colder here in[F]side in [Am]silence [C] 
  You don't have to [Am]keep it [F]quiet[C] 
   
  Chorus: 
  Yeah, I [Am]know it [Em]makes you ner-[C]vous 
  But I [Am]promise [Em]you, it's [F]worth it 
  To show [Am]'em every-[Em]thing you kept in-[G]side 
  Don't [C]hide, don't [Em]hide 
  Too [Am]shy to [Em]say, but I [G]hope you stay 
  Don't [Em]hide a-[Am]way 
  Come out and [C]play
