  Verse 1: 
  [G]It must have been cold there in my [C]shadow, 
  [G]to never have sunlight on your [C]face. [Bm] 
  [Am]You were content to let me [D]shine; that's your way. 
  [Am]You always walked a step be[D]hind. 
   
  Verse 2: 
  [G]So I was the one with all the [C]glory, 
  [G]while you were the one with all the [C]strain. [Bm] 
  [Am]A beautiful face without a [D]name; for so long. 
  [Am]A beautiful smile to hide the [D]pain.[B7] 
   
  Chorus: 
  [Em]Did you ever [C]know that you're my [G]hero, [D] 
  [Em]and everything [C]I would like to [G]be[D]? [B] 
  [Em]I can fly [C]higher than an [G]eagle [D] [G] 
  [Am]for you are the [D]wind beneath my [G]wings. 
   
  Verse 3: 
  [G]It might have appeared to go un[C]noticed, 
  [G]but I've got it all here in my [C]heart. [Bm] 
  [Am]I want you to know I know the [D]truth, of course I know it. 
  [Am]I would be nothing without [D]you. [B7] 
   
  (Chorus) (Chorus)
