  Verse 1: 
  [Em]I can feel the memory in my brain 
  I can feel the [D]cold running through my veins 
  Like it's [G]been, been this way, all of [C]our life 
  Looking in the [Em]mirror through your eyes 
  Nothing makes [D]sense, these tears won't dry 
  I let you [G]down, down and out, never [Am]thought twice 
   
  Chorus 1: 
  But than was [C]then 
  And this is [Em]now 
  I know I [D]said I never, but I know I let you [C]down 
  And it feels [C]dead, in this [Em]town 
  So tell me [D]when will you bring love back [C]around 
  Bring love back [Em]around [D] [C] 
  Love back [Em]around [D] [C] 
   
  Verse 2: 
  Funny [Em]how you never quite realise 
  That you [D]already have paradise 
  Til it's [G]gone, all the way, out of [C]your life 
  Looking in the [Em]mirror, don't know myself 
  Nothing makes [D]sense, this feels like hell 
  I let you [G]down, down and out, never [Am]thought twice 
   
  Chorus 2: 
  But than was [C]then (that was then) 
  And this is [Em]now (this is now) 
  I know I [D]said I never, but I know I let you [C]down 
  And it feels [C]dead, (it feels dead) in this [Em]town (in this down) 
  So tell me [D]when will you bring love back [C]around 
  [D]Love back [Em]around 
  Bring [D]love, oh [C]love, oh [Em]love 
  Bring [D]love back [C]around, yeah 
  Back [Em]around, (bring [D]love), oh [C]oh 
  Oh, [Em]love love love 
  Bring [D]love back [C]around, yeah 
   
  Bridge: 
  Who can I [Em]touch? (with nobody) 
  Who can I [Em]trust? (with nobody) 
  Who can I [Em]love? (with nobody) 
  If it ain't you, you, you 
  Who can I [Am]touch? (with [Bm]nobody) 
  Who can I [Em]trust? (with [Bm]nobody) 
  Who can I [Am]love? (with [Bm]nobody) 
  If it ain't [Em]you, you, you 
   
  (Chorus 2) 
  Your love back around
