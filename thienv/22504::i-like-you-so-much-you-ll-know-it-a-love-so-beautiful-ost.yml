:lyric: |-
   
  I like your [C]eyes, you look away when you pre[Am]tend not to care 
  I like the [Dm]dimples on the corners of the [G]smile that you wear 
  I like you [Em]more, the world may know but [A]don't be scared 
  Coz I'm [Dm]falling deeper, baby [Gsus4]be pre[G]pared 
   
  I like your [C]shirt, I like your fingers, love the [Am]way that you smell 
  to be your [Dm]favorite jacket, just so I could [G]always be near 
  I loved you [Em]for so long, sometimes it's [A]hard to bear 
  But after [Dm]all this time, I hope you [Gsus4]wait and [G]see 
   
  Chorus 
  [C]Love you every minute, [G]every second 
  [Am]Love you everywhere and [Em]any moment 
  [F]Always and forever I [C]know I can't quit you 
  Coz [Dm]baby you're the [G]one, I don't know how 
  [C]Love you til the last of [G]snow disappears 
  [Am]Love you til a rainy [Em]day becomes clear 
  [F]Never knew a love like [C]this, now I can't let go 
  [Dm]I'm in love with [Gsus4]you, and [G]now you [F]know 
  [G] [Am] [Am] [F] [G] [C] [C] 
   
  I like the [C]way you try so hard when you play [Am]ball with your friends, 
  I like the [Dm]way you hit the notes, in every [Gsus4]song you're [G]shining 
  I love the [Em]little things, like when you're [A]unaware 
  I catch you [Dm]steal a glance and smile so [Gsus4]perfec[G]tly 
   
  [F]Though sometimes when [G]life brings me down 
  [E]You're the cure my [Am]love 
  In a [F]bad rainy day 
  You [G7]take all the [G]worries away 
   
  Chorus: 
  [C]Love you every minute, [G]every second 
  [Am]Love you everywhere and [Em]any moment 
  [F]Always and forever I [C]know I can't quit you 
  Coz [Fmaj7]baby you're the [G]one, I don't know how 
  [C]In a world devoid of [G]life, you bring color 
  [Am]In your eyes I see the [Em]light, my future 
  [F]Always and forever with you, [C]now I can't let you go 
  [Fmaj7]I'm in love with [G]you, and now you [C]know
