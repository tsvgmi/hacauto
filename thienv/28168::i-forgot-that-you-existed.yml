  Intro: 
  [F] [Am] [Bb] [C] 
:lyric: |-
  Verse 1: 
  [F] How [Am]many days did I spend thinking 
  [Bb]Bout how you did me [C]wrong, wrong, wrong? 
  [F] Lived [Am]in the shade you were throwing 
  'Til [Bb]all of my sunshine [C]was gone, gone, gone 
  [F] And [Am]I couldn't get away from [Bb]ya 
  [C]In my feelings more than Drake, so [F]yeah 
  Your name [Am]on my lips, tounge-tied 
  [Bb] Free rent, [C]living in my mind 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  [F] But [Em]then something [Dm]happened one magical [Bb]night [C] 
   
  Chorus: 
  I forgot that you [F]existed [Am] [Bb] 
  And [C]I thought that it would kill me, but it [FAm]didn't [Bb] [C] 
  And it was so[F] [Am]ni----ce [Bb] [C] 
  So peaceful and [FAm]qui----et [Bb] [C] 
  I forgot that you [F]existed [Am] [Bb] 
  It [C]isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just [FAm]indifference [Bb] [C] 
  I forgot that [F]you 
   
  Verse 2: 
  Got [Am]out some popcorn 
  As soon as my [Bb]rep started [C]going down, down, down 
  [F] Laughed [Am]on the school yard 
  As soon as I [Bb]tripped up and hit [C]the ground, ground, ground 
  [F] And [Am]I would've stuck around for [Bb]ya 
  [C]Would've fought the whole town, so [F]yeah 
  Would've been [Am]right there, front row 
  [Bb] Even if [C]nobody came to your show 
   
  (Pre-Chorus) (Chorus) 
   
  Bridge: 
  [Bb]Sent me a clear message 
  [Dm] Taught me some hard lessons 
  [C] I just forget what they [C]were 
  PAUSE 
  It's all just a blur 
   
  (Chorus)
