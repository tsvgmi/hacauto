  Verse 1: 
  [A]I used to [D]shut my [F#m]door while my mother [E]screamed in the kitchen 
  [A]I'd turn [D]the music [F#m]up, get high and [E]try not to listen 
  [A]To every little [D]fight, 'cause [F#m]neither one was [E]right 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  [A]I swore I'd never be like [D]them 
  But [F#m]I was just a kid back [E]then 
   
  Chorus: 
  The older I [D]get the more that I [E]see 
  My parents aren't [A]heroes, they're just like [F#m]me 
  And loving is [D]hard, it don't always [E]work 
  You just try your [A]best not to get [F#m]hurt 
  I used to be [D]mad but now I [E]know 
  Sometimes it's [A]better to let [F#m]someone go 
  It just hadn't [D]hit me yet 
  The older I [A]get 
   
  Verse 2: 
  I used to [D]wonder [F#m]why, why they could [E]never be happy 
  [A]I used to [D]close my [F#m]eyes and pray for a [E]whole 'nother family 
  Where [A]everything was [D]fine, [F#m]one that felt like [E]mine 
   
  (Pre-Chorus)
