  Chorus: Ed Sheeran: 
  I've been up for a thousand [Em]nights 
  [Am7]New York to London, different city every [Em]day, yeah 
  Playin' on, [Am7]playin' on, puttin' on 50 thousand [Em]lights 
  Oh, [Am7]I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' [Em]faded 
  So I'm on, [Am7]keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand [Em]nights 
   
  Verse 1: Meek Mill: 
  This the type of shit we used to dream of (Yeah, yeah) 
  [Am7]Bad bitch look like Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa) 
  [Em]Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza (Splash, water) 
  [Am7]Clear port, hasta la vista 
  Do it all again when [Em]we touchdown, everything bust down 
  [Am7]Teacher said I would lose, I be like, "What now?" 
  [Em]I started makin' moves, they showin' me love now 
  [Am7]Lit like a light bulb 'cause, [Em]bitch, I'm the plug now 
  And [Em]now you know we poppin', we bubble like soda pop 
  And I see it, I [Am7]like it, I wake up, pull up, and go and cop it 
  The millions get [Em]wired, them Benny hunnids still go in pocket 
  I party with Ed Sheeran, my homies still hold the rocket 
  'Cause [Em]I'm so hood, it don't make no sense 
  Still [Am7]remember the times I couldn't pay my rent 
  Now, I [Em]walk in a stadium, tell 'em, "Play my shit" 
  And they gon' sing like this 
   
  Chorus: Ed Sheeran: 
  I've been up for a thousand [Em]nights 
  [Am7]New York to London, different city every [Em]day, yeah 
  Playin' on, [Am7]playin' on, puttin' on 50 thousand [Em]lights 
  Oh, [Am7]I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' [Em]faded 
  So I'm on, [Am7]keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand [Em]nights 
   
  Verse 2: Ed Sheeran: 
  [Em]Last night, I played a show at a stadium in Atlanta 
  [Am7]Husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras 
  [Em]I never thought it would get this big, but what does it matter? 
  [Am7]Everything [Em]is already part of a plan 
  I [Em]remember, damn, me and my man inside of this Sprinter van 
  [Am7]200 a night, end of 2010 
  Stayin' up [Em]in every city's Holiday Inn 
  If it [Am7]wasn't there, then I was at the couch of a friend's 
  [Em]Weatherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper [Am7]lunch and 
   
  £2 pint, the waitress maybe leave her number 
  [Em]Onto the next town, but now it's to the next continent (Woo) 
  [Am7]And I don't think it's gonna be stoppin' anytime soon 
  [Em]Birds eye view, pay my dues for a two-mile queue 
  Don't need to [Am7]read reviews if you can't do the things [Em]I do 
  Oh, let me invite you to my world 
   
  Chorus: Ed Sheeran: 
  I've been up for a thousand [Em]nights 
  [Am7]New York to London, different city every [Em]day, yeah 
  Playin' on, [Am7]playin' on, puttin' on 50 thousand [Em]lights 
  Oh, [Am7]I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' [Em]faded 
  So I'm on, [Am7]keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand [Em]nights 
   
  Verse 3: A Boogie wit da Hoodie: 
  Mmm, I'm so faded, yeah 
  I don't even know how much I made this year 
  I'm so used to bein' on some player shit 
  Cheated on my girlfriend with a fiendish bitch 
  [Em]Hoodie on pull up, just like the Reaper, yeah 
  I do [Am7]this on the regular, make you seem off, yeah 
  St. [Em]Laurent, Gucci sweater, the red and green Moncler 
  Me and [Am7]Meek and Ed Sheeran just like the Beatles, yeah 
  From her [Em]head to her toe, she know she be flee, yeah 
  [Am7]Everyday, I be seein' her and Selena, yeah 
  [Em]She wanna come closer, but I don't see us there 
  I'm not a [Am7]regular person, I be low-key all year 
  From [Em]New York out to London she was, she was with me all the time 
  And [Am7]I've been on the road, so I know she couldn't call my line 
  And [Em]now I see she got her ass and titties done for a thousand likes, [Em]meh 
   
  Chorus: Ed Sheeran: 
  I've been up for a thousand [Em]nights 
  [Am7]New York to London, different city every [Em]day, yeah 
  Playin' on, [Am7]playin' on, puttin' on 50 thousand [Em]lights 
  Oh, [Am7]I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' [Em]faded 
  So I'm on, [Am7]keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand [Em]nights
