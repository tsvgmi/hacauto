:lyric: |-
  With your [G]loving, there ain't nothing 
  That [F]I can't a[C]dore 
  The way I'm [G]running, with you, honey 
  Means we can [F]break every [C]law 
  I find it [G]funny that you're the only 
  One I [F]never looked [C]for 
  There is [G]something in your loving 
  That [F]tears down my [C]walls 
  I wasn't ready [G]then, I'm ready now 
  I'm [F]heading straight for [C]you 
  You will [G]only be eternally 
  The [F]one that I belong [C]to 
   
  The [G]sweetest de[F]vo[C]tion 
  [G]Hitting me like an ex[F]plo[G]sion 
  [G]All of my life, I've been [F]fro[G]zen 
  The [G]sweetest de[F]vo[G]tion I've [Em]known 
  ([G G F C]) x 4 
   
  I'll for[G]ever be whatever you [F]want me to [C]be 
  I'll go [G]under and all over for [F]your clari[C]ty 
  When you [G]wonder if I'm gonna [F]lose my way [C]home 
  Just [G]remember, that come whatever, I'll be [F]yours all [C]alone 
  I wasn't [G]ready then, I'm ready now 
  I'm [F]heading straight for [C]you 
  You will [G]only be eternally 
  The [F]one that I belong [C]to 
   
  The [G]sweetest de[F]vo[C]tion 
  [G]Hitting me like an ex[F]plo[C]sion 
  [G]All of my life, I've been [F]fro[C]zen 
  [G]The sweetest de[F]vo[G]tion I've [Em]known 
  ([G G F C]) x 2 
   
  I've been [F]looking for you, baby 
  In [C]every face that I've ever [G]known 
  And [F]there is something 'bout the way you love [C]me 
  That finally [G]feels like home 
  You're my [Em]light, you're my [F]darkness 
  You're the [Em]right kind of [F]madness 
  And you're [Em]my hope, you're my [F]despair 
  You're my [Em]scope, everything, everywhere 
   
  The [G]sweetest de[F]vo[C]tion 
  [G]Hitting me like an ex[F]plo[C]sion 
  [G]All of my life, I've been [F]fro[C]zen 
  The [G]sweetest de[F]vo[C]tion I've [G]known [F C ] 
  [G G F C ] 
   
  [G]Sweetest 
  It's the [F]swee[C]test 
  [G]Sweetest 
  It's the [F]swee[C]test 
  [G]Sweetest 
  It's the [F]swee[C]test 
  [G]Sweetest 
  It's the [F]swee[C]test 
  Devo[G]tion
