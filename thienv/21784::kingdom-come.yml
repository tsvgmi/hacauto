  <Verse 1> 
  [Em]Run, run, run away 
  [Em]Buy yourself another day 
  [Am]A cold wind's whisper[Em]ing 
  [B]Secrets in your [Em]ear 
  [Am]So low o[Em]nly you can h[B]ear [D]Ho - [B]oh 
   
  [Em]Run, run, run and hide 
  [Em]Somewhere no one else can find 
  [Am]Tall trees b[Em]end their lean po[B]inting where to [Em]go 
  [Am]Where you will s[Em]till be all alo[B]ne [B]Ho - [D]oh 
   
  <Chorus> 
  [Am]Don't yo[G]u f[D]ret [Em]my de[D]ar 
  It'll [Am]all [G]be [D]ov[Em]-er s[D]oon 
  [Am]I'll [G]be w[D]ai-t[Em]ing [D]here [B] 
  For y[Em]ou 
   
  <Verse 2> 
  [Em]Run fast as you can 
  [Em]No one has to understand 
  [Am]Fly high acr[Em]oss the sky from [B]here to kingdom c[Em]ome 
  [Am]Fall back d[Em]own to where you're [B]from o[D]o - o[B]o 
   
  <Chorus> 
  [Am]Don't yo[G]u fret [D]my de[Em]ar [D] 
  It'll [Am]all [G]be [D]ov[Em]-er [D]soon 
  [Am]I'll [G]be [D]wai- [Em]ting [D]he-e[B]e-ee[D]-ere 
  for y[Em]ou 
  For y[Em]ou, for y[Am]ou 
  [C] [D] 
  [Am]Don't yo[G]u fr[D]et [Em]my de[D]ar (Don't you fret, my dear) 
  It'll [Am]all [G]be [D]ov[Em]-er [D]soon (It'll all be over soon) 
  [Am]I'll [G]be w[D]ai- [Em]ting [D]he-ee[B]eere 
   
  [Am]Don't yo[G]u f[D]ret [Em]my de[D]ar oh 
  It'll a[Am]ll b[G]e [D]ov[Em]-er [D]soon 
  [Am]I'll [G]be w[D]ai- t[Em]ing h[D]e-e[B]e-ere
