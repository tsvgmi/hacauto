  Chorus: 
  You prolly think that you are [Am]better now, better now 
  You only say that 'cause I'm [D]not around, not around 
  You know I never meant to [G]let you down, let you down 
  Woulda gave you anything, [C]woulda gave you everything 
  You know I say that I am [Am]better now, better now 
  I only say that 'cause you're [D]not around, not around 
  You know I never meant to [G]let you down, let you down 
  Woulda gave you anything, [C]woulda gave you everything 
  Oh-oh 
   
  Verse 1: 
  [Am]I did not believe that it would end, no 
  [D]Everything came second to the Benzo 
  [G]You're not even speakin' to my friends, no 
  [C]You knew all my uncles and my aunts though 
  [Am]Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes 
  [D]We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives 
  [G]Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside 
  [C]Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like 
  And I'm [Am]rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' 
  With my [D]brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas 
  Drinkin' [G]Henny and I'm tryna forget 
  But I [C]can't get this shit outta my head 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  Verse 2: 
  [Am]I seen you with your other dude 
  [D]He seemed like he was pretty cool 
  [G]I was so broken over you 
  [C]Life it goes on, what can you do? 
  I just [Am]wonder what it’s gonna take 
  Another [D]foreign or a bigger chain 
  Because no [G]matter how my life has changed 
  I keep on [C]looking back on better days 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  Bridge: 
  I [Am]promise 
  I swear to you, [D]I'll be okay 
  You're [G]only the love of my [C]life 
   
  (Chorus)
