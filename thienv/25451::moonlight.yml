:lyric: |-
   
  [Em]I bought you things that I didn't even have the money for 
  [Bm]If I could make you feel so rich, I don't mind feeling poor 
  [C]There's something about you so addictive, had me needing more 
   
  [G]Yeah, I just wanna hold you 
  Baby, you the one I want 
   
  [Em]I know I've said this all before but I'll say it again 
  [D]You the only one I want and girl, I can't pretend 
  [C]I remember cloudy days we cuddled in my bed 
  [G]The thought of losing you just makes no sense inside my head 
   
  [Em]You the reason I believe that love is real 
  [D]Ain't nobody make me feel the way you make me feel 
  [C]Darling, tell me is it real? 
  [G]Or was I lying to myself just to [D]make it feel so [Em]real? 
   
  Chorus: 
  Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love [D]you 
  Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want [C]you 
  Ain't nobody gon' trust you like I trust [G]you 
  Ain't nobody gon ' ain't nobody [Em]gon' 
  Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love [D]you 
  Ain't nobody gon' trust you like I trust [C]you 
  Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want [G]you 
  Ain't nobody gon' wanna no no [Em]no 
   
  [Em]I can't love nobody anymore 
  [Bm]You the only one that I ever want 
  [C]I compare her to you, she has never won 
  [G]Now I wanna just be all alone 
   
  [Em]Nobody love me like you 
  And I can't love nobody back 
  [Bm]You remind me of the moon 
  Cuz' every night you coming [Em]back 
  [C]What am I supposed to do? 
  If I'm so in love with you 
  [G]I cannot get over you 
  [D]I cannot get over you [Em] 
   
  [Em]Since you left me every night I go stare at the moon [D] 
  [Bm]Wishing it was you and I that's something we would do [C] 
  [C]Every Sunday morning I go watch the flowers bloom 
  [G]I do things we used to do [D]hoping I'll run into [Em]you 
   
  What's a lie and what's the [G]truth 
  I cannot get over [D]you 
  Doesn't matter what I do 
  Everyone just looks like [C]you 
  Girl, I smell you everywhere 
  Smell your perfume and your [G]hair 
  I try to act like I don't care 
  Everyone [D]knows that I [Em]care 
   
  [Em]You the reason I believe that love is real 
  [D]Ain't nobody make me feel the way you make me feel 
  [C]Darling, tell me is it real? 
  [G]Or was I lying to myself just to [D]make it feel so [Em]real? 
   
  (Chorus)
