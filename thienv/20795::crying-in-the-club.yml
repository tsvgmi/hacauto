  Verse 1: 
  [Em]You [D]think that [Bm7]you'll die without [C]him 
  [Em]You [D]know, that's a [Bm7]lie that you tell [C]yourself 
  [Em]You [D]fear that you [Bm7]lay alone forever [C]now 
  [Em]It ain't [D]true, ain't [Bm7]true, ain't [C]true, no 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  [Em]So put your [D]arms around me tonight 
  Let the [Bm7]music lift you up 
  Like you've [C]never been so high 
  [Em]Open up your [D]heart to me 
  Let the [Bm7]music lift you up 
  Like you've [C]never been this free 
  [Em]'Til you feel the [D]sunrise 
  Let the [Bm7]music warm your body 
  Like the [C]heat of a thousand [Em]fires 
  The [D]heat of a thousand [Bm7]fires [C] 
   
  Chorus: 
  Ain't no crying in the [Em]club (hey, hey) 
  Let the [D]beat carry, your [Bm7]tears as they fall, [C]baby 
  Ain't no crying in the [Em]club (hey, hey) 
  With a [D]little faith, your [Bm7]tears turn to [C]ecstasy 
  Ain't no crying in the [Em]club [D] [Bm7] [C] 
  I won't, I won't, I... 
  Ain't no crying in the [Em]club [D] [Bm7] [C] 
  I won't, I won't, I... 
  Ain't no crying in the [Em]club 
   
  Verse 2: 
  [Em]You may [D]think that [Bm7]you'll die without [C]her 
  [Em]But [D]you know, that's a [Bm7]lie that you told [C]yourself 
  [Em]You [D]fear that you'll [Bm7]never meet another so [Em]pure 
  [Em]It ain't [D]true, ain't [Bm7]true, ain't [C]true, [Em]no 
   
  (Pre-Chorus) 
  (Chorus) 
   
  Bridge: 
  [Em]You [D]think that [Bm7]you'll die without [C]him 
  [Em]You [D]know, that's a [Bm7]lie that you tell [C]yourself 
  [Em]You [D]fear that you [Bm7]lay alone forever [C]now 
  [Em]It ain't [D]true, ain't [Bm7]true, ain't [C]true 
  I said [Em]ain't no... (ain't no...) 
  [D]Ain't no crying... 
  [Bm7]Ain't no crying in the [C]club, no crying... 
  [Em]I said ain't no... (ain't no...) 
  [D]Ain't no crying... 
  [Bm7]Ain't no crying in the club, [C]no crying... 
  Woah! 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  Ain't no crying in the [Em]club [D] [Bm7] [C](I won't 
  cry, I won't cry, I won't cry no more) 
  I won't, I won't, I... 
  Ain't no crying in the [Em]club [D] [Bm7] [C](I 
  won't cry, I won't cry, I won't cry no more) 
  I won't, I won't, I... 
  Ain't no crying in the [Em]club
