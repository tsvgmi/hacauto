  Verse 1: 
  What is it [A]about them? 
  I must be missing [E]something 
  They just keep doing [Bm]nothing 
  Too [Dm]intoxicated to be scared 
  Better off [A]without them 
  They're nothing but [E]unstable 
  Bring ashtrays to the [Bm]table 
  And that's about the [Dm]only thing they share 
   
  Chorus: 
  I'm[F#m]in their second [Faug]hand smoke 
  [A]Still just drinking [B/D#]canned Coke 
  I[Bm]don't need a Xanny to feel better 
  On [F#m]designated [Faug]drives home 
  [A]Only one who's [B/D#]not stoned 
  [Bm]Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever 
   
  Interlude: 
   
  Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god 
   
  (And it's like, wait, like, when?) 
   
  Verse 2: 
  Wakin' up at [A]sundown (Ooh) 
  They're late to [E]every party (Ooh) 
  Nobody's ever [Bm]sorry (Ooh) 
  Too inebriated [Dm]now to dance 
  Morning as they [A]come down (Come down) 
  Their pretty heads [E]are hurting (Hurting) 
  They're awfully bad at [Bm]learning (Learning) 
  Make the same [Dm]mistakes, blame circumstance 
   
  Chorus: 
  [F#m]I'm in their second [Faug]hand smoke 
  [A]Still just drinking [B/D#]canned Coke 
  I[Bm]don't need a Xanny to feel better 
  [F#m]On designated [Faug]drives home 
  [A]Only one who's [B/D#]not stoned 
  [Bm]Don't give me a Xanny, now or [EE7]ever 
   
  Bridge: 
  [Bm]Please don't try to kiss me on the [EE7]sidewalk 
  On your [F#m]cigarette [Faug]break [A] [D#dim] 
  I [Bm]can't afford to love [E]someone 
  Who [E7]isn't dying [F#m]by [Faug]mistake in 
  [A]Silver [D#dim]Lake 
  [Bm] [E] 
   
  Outro: 
  What is it about [A]them? 
  I must be missing [E]something 
  They just keep doin' [Bm]nothing 
  N.C 
  Too intoxicated to be scared 
  [A]Hmm, [E]hmm 
  [Bm]Hmm, [F#m]mmm, [Faug]mmm, [A]mmm, mmm 
  [A]Come down 
  [E]Hurting 
  [BmFaug]Learning
