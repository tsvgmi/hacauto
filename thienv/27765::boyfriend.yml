  Intro: 
  [F] [E7] [Am] [D5] 
:lyric: |-
  Verse 1: 
  I'm a motherfuckin' [F]train wreck 
  I don't wanna [E7]be too much 
  But I don't wanna [Am]miss your touch 
  And you don't seem to [D5]give a fuck 
   
  I don't wanna keep you [F]waiting 
  But I do just what I [E7]have to do 
  And I might not be the [Am]one for you 
  But you ain't about to [D5]have no boo 
   
  Pre-Chorus 1: 
  'Cause [F]I know we be so complicated 
  [E7]But we be so smitten, it's crazy 
  [Am]I can't have what I want but neither can [D5]you 
   
  Chorus 1: 
  You ain't my [F]boyfriend (boyfriend) 
  And I ain't your [E7]girlfriend (girlfriend) 
  But you don't want me to [Am]see nobody else 
  And I don't want you to [D5]see nobody (x2) 
   
  Verse 2: 
  Even though you ain't [F]mine 
  I promise the way we [E7]fight 
  Make me honestly feel like [Am]we just in love 
  'Cause, baby, when [Dm]push comes to shove 
   
  Damn baby, I'm a [F]train wreck, too (too) 
  I lose my [E7]mind when it comes to you 
  I take [Am]time with the ones I choose 
  And I don't want to [D5]smile if it ain't from you, yeah 
   
  Pre-Chorus 2: 
  [F]I know we be so complicated 
  [E7]Lovin' you sometimes drive me crazy 
  'Cause [Am]I can't have what I want and neither can [D5]you 
   
  (Chorus) (x2) 
   
  Verse 3: 
  [F]I wanna kiss you (yeah), don't wanna miss you (yeah) 
  But [E7]I can't be with you 'cause I got issues 
  [Am]Yeah, on the surface, seem like it's easy 
  [Dm]Careful with words, but it's still hard to read me 
   
  [F]Stress high when the trust low (mmm) 
  [E7]Bad vibes, where'd the fun go? (oh) 
  [Am]Try to open up and love more (love more) 
  [D5]Try to open up and love more 
   
  Bridge: 
  If you were my [F]boyfriend 
  And you were my [E7]girlfriend 
  I probably wouldn't [Am]see nobody else 
  But I can't [Dm]guarantee that by myself 
   
  (Chorus) (x5) 
   
  [F] [E7] [Am] [D5]
