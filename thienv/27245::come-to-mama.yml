  Verse 1: 
  [C]Everybody's got to [E]love each [Am]other 
  [C]Stop throwin' stones at your [E]sisters and your [Am]brothers 
  [G]Man, it wasn't that [E]long ago we 
  were all [Am]living in the [GD]jungle 
  So why do we [G]gotta [G]put each other down 
  When there's [G]more than enough love [G]to g-g-go around? 
   
  Chorus: 
  Come to [C]mama 
  Tell me who [Am]hurt ya 
  There's gonna be no [F]future 
  If we don't figure this [Fm]out 
   
  Verse 2: 
  [C]Dude in a lab coat and a [E]man of [Am]God 
  [C]Fought over prisms and a [E]forty-day [Am]flood 
  [G]Well, I say [E]rainbows did more [Am]than they've [G]ever [D]done 
  So why do we [G]gotta [G]fight over ideas? 
  We're talkin' the [G]same old shit after [G]all of these years 
   
  Chorus: 
  Come to [C]mama 
  Tell me who [Am]hurt ya 
  There's gonna be no [F]future 
  If we don't figure this [Fm]out 
  Oh, come [C]tomorrow 
  Who are you gonna [Am]follow? 
  There's gonna be no [F]future 
  If we don't figure this [Fm]out 
   
  Bridge: 
  [C]Psychic guru catches [E]minnows in the [Am]harbor 
  [C]Everyone tells him he should [E]work a little [Am]harder 
  [G]They all tell you that [E]freedom must 
  be bought But, baby, [Am]he's already [G]caught[D]them 
  So why do we [G]gotta tell [G]each other how to live? 
  The only [G]prisons that exist are ones we [G]put each other in 
   
  Chorus: 
  Come to[C]mama 
  Tell me who [Am]hurt ya 
  There's gonna be no [F]future 
  If we don't figure this [Fm]out 
  Oh, come [C]tomorrow 
  Who are you gonna [Am]follow? 
  There's gonna be no [F]future 
  If we don't figure this [Fm]out 
   
  Come to [C]mama (Come onto me)[Am] 
  Come on [F]mama Come on mama 
  [Fm]Come on mama 
   
  [C] [Am] 
  [F]'Cause I wanna be there 
  I wanna be there for[Fm]you I wanna be there 
   
  [C]Why do we gotta tell each other how to [Am]live? 
  The only prisons that exist are ones we put each other [F]in 
  Why do we gotta tell each other how to live?[Fm]Look what that rainbow did
