:lyric: "Verse 1: \nI've [C#m]cheated and I've lied \nI've [A]broke down and I've
  cried \nI've [E]got nothing to hide no [B]more \nI've [C#m]loved and I've hurt \nBroken
  [A]people down with words \nMore [E]grace than I deserve, for [B]sure \n \nPre-Chorus: \nKnown
  to be [C#m]crazy, known to be wild \nMama had [A]herself a little devilish child \nAin't
  no [E]stranger to the troubles at my [B]door \n \nChorus: \nI've been at the [C#m]wrong
  place at the wrong time \nChasing all the [A]wrong things most of my life \nBeen
  every kinda [E]lost that you can't find \nBut I got [B]one thing right \nBeen the
  kinda [C#m]guy girls mamas don't like \nRunning\x80\x99 with [A]the wrong crowd
  on the wrong nights \nCause I've been [E]wrong about a million times \nBut I got
  [B]one thing right... \nYou [C#m](Baby, I got one thing right) \n[A](Baby, I got
  one thing right) \nYeah, I got [E]you (Baby, I got one thing right) \nI got [B]one
  thing right \n \nVerse 2: \nYou [C#m]saw right through my pain \nKept us [A]patient
  while I changed \nNever [E]even crossed your mind to walk [B]away \n \n(Pre-Chorus)
  (Chorus) \n \nBridge: \nI've been [C#m]wrong about a million [A]times \nBut I got
  one thing [E]right, I got one thing [B]right \n \n(Chorus) \n \nOutro: \nI've been
  at the [C#m]wrong place at the wrong time \nChasing all the [A]wrong things most
  of my life \nBeen every kinda [E]lost that you can't find \nBut I got [B]one thing
  right [C#m] "
