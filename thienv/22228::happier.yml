  Intro: 
  [Dm]Lately, I've been, [C/E]I've been [F]thinking 
  I want you to be [Bbmaj7]happier, I want you to be happier 
   
  Verse 1: 
  When the morning [Dm]comes 
  When we see what [C/E]we've be [F]come 
  In the cold light of day we're a [Bbmaj7]flame in the wind 
  Not the fire that we've begun 
  Every [C]argu [Dm]ment, every [C/E]word we can't take [F]back 
  'Cause with the all that has happened 
  I [Bbmaj7]think that we both know the way 
  that the [Bbmaj7]story [Bbmaj7]ends [C] 
   
  Chorus: 
  Then [Dm]only for a minute [C/E] [F] 
  I want to change my [Bbmaj7]mind 
  'Cause this just don't feel right to me 
  I [Dm]want to raise your spirits [C/E] [F] 
  I want to see you [Bbmaj7]smile but 
  Know that means I'll have to leave 
  [Dm] [C/E] [F] 
  [Bbmaj7]Know that means I'll have to leave 
  [Dm]Lately, I've been, [C/E]I've been [F]thinking 
  I want you to be [Bbmaj7]happier, I want you to be happier 
   
  Verse 2: 
  When the evening [Dm]falls 
  And I'm left there [C/E]with my [F]thoughts 
  And the image of you being [Bbmaj7]with someone else 
  Well, that's eating me up inside 
  [C]But we run our [Dm]course, we pretended [C/E]we're [F]okay 
  Now if we jump together at [Bbmaj7]least we can swim 
  Far away from the wreck we made 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  Bridge: 
  So I'll [Bbmaj7]go, I'll [F]go 
  I will go, [C/E]go, [Dm]go [C] 
  So I'll [Bbmaj7]go, I'll [F]go 
  I will [C/E]go, go, go 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  [Dm]Lately, I've been, [C/E]I've been [F]thinking 
  I want you to be [Bbmaj7]happier, I want you to be happier [C] 
  [Dm]Even though I [C/E]might not [F]like this 
  I think that you'll be [Bbmaj7]happier, I want you to be happier [C] 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  Outro: 
  [C]So I'll [Dm]go, I'll [F]go 
  I will go, go, [Gm]gowill go, go, go
