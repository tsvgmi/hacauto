  Intro: 
  |[C] [Gm] |[Fsus2] [F] |[C] [Gm] |[Fsus2] [F] | (X2) 
  Verse 1: 
  [C]Once upon a time, it [Gm]was paradise 
  [Fsus2]Once upon a time, I [F]was paralyzed 
  [C]Think I'm gonna miss [Gm]these harbor lights 
  But it's [Fsus2]time to let it [F]go 
  [C]Once upon a time, it [Gm]was made for us 
  [Fsus2]Woke up one day, it [F]had turned to dust 
  [C]Baby, we were found, [Gm]but now we're lost 
  So it's [Fsus2]time to let it [F]go 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  [C] I want [Gm]my house in the hills 
  [Fsus2] Don't want [F]the whiskey and pills 
  [C] I don't [Gm]give up easily 
  [Fsus2]But I don't [F]think I'm down 
   
  Chorus: 
  So won't you [C]slide away 
  [Gm]Back to the ocean, [Fsus2]I'll go [F]back to the city lights 
  So won't you [C]slide away 
  [Gm]Back to the ocean,[Fsus2] la-la-la, [F]you'll slide away 
  So won't you [C]slide away 
  [Gm]Back to the ocean, [Fsus2]I'll go [F]back to the city lights 
  So won't you [C]slide away 
  [Gm]Back to the ocean,[Fsus2] la-la-la, [F]you'll slide away 
   
  Verse 2: 
  [C]Once upon a time, it [Gm]was paradise 
  [Fsus2]Once upon a time, I [F]was paralyzed 
  [C]Think I'm gonna miss [Gm]these harbor lights 
  But it's [Fsus2]time to let it [F]go 
  [C]Once upon a time, it [Gm]was made for us 
  [Fsus2]Woke up one day, it [F]had turned to dust 
  [C]Baby, we were found, [Gm]but now we're lost 
  So it's [Fsus2]time to let it [F]go 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  [C] Move on, [Gm]we're not 17 
  [Fsus2] I'm not [F]who I used to be 
  [C] You say [Gm]that everything changed 
  [Fsus2] You're right, [F]we're grown now 
   
  Chorus: 
  So won't you [C]slide away 
  [Gm]Back to the ocean, [Fsus2]I'll go [F]back to the city lights 
  So won't you [C]slide away 
  [Gm]Back to the ocean,[Fsus2] la-la-la, [F]you'll slide away 
  So won't you [C]slide away 
  [Gm]Back to the ocean, [Fsus2]I'll go [F]back to the city lights 
  So won't you [C]slide away 
  [Gm]Back to the ocean,[Fsus2] la-la-la, [F]you'll slide away
