:lyric: "Tone Hồ Ngọc Hà là Gm. \nChord cycle (vòng hợp âm): [GmDmEbF\r] \n \n[Gm
  ]Give me a reason, [Dm ]give me a sign \n[Eb ]Give me something that [F ]shows me
  you're mine \n[Gm ]Give me a kiss, [Dm ]show me your love \n[Eb ]Is it [F ]me you
  have been [Gm ]dreaming off. \n \nCause you are so cold, you are so [Dm ]blind \nI
  try to [Eb ]comfort you but you look [F ]away \nHave you lost your [Gm ]love, have
  you lost [Dm ]your lust \nOr is it the [Eb ]end of our [F ]never ending [Gm ]story? \n \nChorus \nIs
  it the end. [Dm ]Is this really the [Eb ]end \nYour silence says it [F ]all \nIt's
  like talking to a [Gm ]wall \nDon't take your love [Dm ]away \nBaby why can't you
  [Eb ]stay \nIs this [F ]really the [Gm ]end? \n \nWhat have I done wrong [Dm ]Is
  it something that I said \n[Eb ]Looking at your photos [F ]makes me really sad \n[Gm
  ]Is there someone else [Dm ]who has taken your love \n[Eb ]Is it someone [F ]else
  that you have been [Gm ]dreaming off? "
