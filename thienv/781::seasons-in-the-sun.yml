  known each other since we were [Em]nine or ten [D#aug Em/D\r] \n[A7/C#]Together
  we climbed [D]hills and trees,  [F#m/C# D\r] \n[D]Learned of [Em]love A B C ; skinned
  our [A7]harts and skinned our [D]knees. \n \n[D]Good bye my friend it`s hard to
  [D]die,  [F#m/C# D\r] \nwhen [Em]all the birds are singing in the sky [D#aug Em/D\r] \nNow
  that the [A7]spring is [D]in the air [F#m/C# D\r] \nPretty [D]girls are ev'ry [Em]where, \n[A7]think
  of me [D]and I`ll be there \n \n(Refrain). We [D]had joy, we had [D/F#]fun, [G]we
  had seasons in the sun, \nBut the [Em]hills that we [A7]climb were just [D]seasons
  out of time. \n \nGoodbye Papa, please pray for [D]me [F#m/C# D\r] \nI was the Black
  Sheep of the [Em]Family [D#aug Em/D\r] \nYou tried to [A7]teach me right from [D]wrong
  [F#m/C# D\r] \nToo much wine and too much [Em]song \nWonder [A7]how I got along \n \nGoodbye
  Papa, it's hard to [D]die [F#m/C# D\r] \nWhen all the bird's are singing [Em]in
  the sky [D#aug Em/D\r] \nNow that the [A7]spring is in the [D]air [F#m/C# D\r] \nLittle
  Children every[Em]where \n[A7]When you see them I'll be [D]there \n \n(Refrain in
  [D]) (Refrain in [F]) \n \nGoodbye Michelle, my little [D]one  [F#m/C# D\r] \nYou
  gave me Love and helped me [Em]find the sun [D#aug Em/D\r] \nAnd every [A7]time
  when I was [D]down  [F#m/C# D\r] \nYou would always come [Em]around \nAnd get my
  [A7]feet back on the [D]ground \n \nGoodbye Michelle, it's hard to [D]die  [F#m/C#
  D\r] \nWhen all the birds are singing [Em]in the sky [D#aug Em/D\r] \nNow that the
  [A7]spring is in the [D]air  [F#m/C# D\r] \nWith the flowers every[En]where \n[A7]I
  wish that we could both be [D]there \n \n(Refrain in [D]) (Refrain in [F]) \n \nAll
  our [F]lives we had [F/A]fun, we had [Bb]Seasons in the sun \nbut the [Gm]stars
  we could [C]reach were just starfish on the [F]beach "
