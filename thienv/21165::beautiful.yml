  <Chorus> 
  [D]Hey 
  Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful [F#]angel 
  Love your imperfections every [Bm]angle 
  [A]Tomorrow comes and goes before you [G]know 
  So [Gm]I just had to let you know 
   
  <Post-Chorus 1> 
  [D]The way that Gucci look on you, amazing 
  [F#]But nothing can compare to when you're naked 
  Now a [Bm]Backwood and some Henny got you [A]faded 
  You're saying [G]you're the one for me, I need to [Gm]face it 
   
  <Verse 1> 
  [D]Started when we were younger 
  Swear to God that I loved her 
  [F#]Sorry that your mum found out 
  Guess that we just really had the thunder 
  [Bm]Ain't nobody else said I'd be under 
  [A]Beautiful, beautiful life right now 
  [G]Beautiful, beautiful night right now 
  No, no, [Gm]no 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  <Post-Chorus 2> 
  [D]The way that dress fall off you is amazing 
  Love a [F#]miracle, a beautiful creation 
  Baby, [Bm]come a little closer let me [A]taste it 
  You [G]came a little closer, now you're [Gm]shaking 
   
  <Verse 2> 
  [D]Never ever gon' mislead you 
  Don't believe the lies they feed you 
  [F#]Stop and stare like a sculpture 
  Painted in your colors 
  [Bm]Beautiful, beautiful life right now 
  [A]Beautiful, beautiful night right now 
  [G]Beautiful, beautiful by my side right [Gm]now 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  <Post-Chorus 3> 
  [D]The way that Gucci look on you amazing 
  [F#]But nothing can compare to when you're naked[Bm] 
  [A]Tomorrow comes and goes before you [G]know 
  [Gm]So I just had to let you know 
  [D]I just had to let you know[F#] 
  Swear to God you're [Bm]beautiful (yeah)[A] [G] [Gm] [D]
