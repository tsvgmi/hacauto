  Chorus: [C]. Ah, look at all the lonely [Em]people! 
  [C]. Ah, look at all the lonely [Em]people! 
   
  [Em]. Eleanor Rigby, 
  .Picks up the [Em]rice in a church where a wedding has [C]been, 
  .Lives in a [Em]dream. 
  . Waits at the window, 
  .Wearing the [Em]face that she keeps in a [D]jar by the [C]door, 
  .Who is it [Em]f or? 
  . All [Em7]the lonely [Em6]people, 
  . Where [Cmaj7]do they all come [Em/B]from? 
  . All [Em7]the lonely [Em6]people, 
  . Where [Cmaj7]do they all [Em/B]bel ong? 
   
  [Em]Father McKenzie, 
  Writing the [Em]words of a sermon that no one will [C]hear, 
  No one comes [Em]near. 
  Look at him [Em]working, 
  Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody [C]there, 
  What does he [Em]care? 
  [Em7]All the lonely [Em6]people, 
  Where [Cmaj7]do they all come [Em/B]from? 
  [Dm7]All the lonely [Dm6]people, 
  Where [Cmaj7]do they all [Em/B]belong? 
   
  (Chorus) 
  [Em]Eleanor Rigby, 
  Died in the church and was buried along with her [C]name, 
  Nobody [Em]came. 
  Father McKenzie, 
  Wiping the [Em]dirt from his hands as he walks from the [C]grave, 
  No one was [Em]saved. 
  [Em7]All the lonely [Em6]people, 
  Where [Cmaj7]do they all come [Em]from? 
  [Em7]All the lonely [Em6]people, 
  Where [Cmaj7]do they all [Em]belong?
