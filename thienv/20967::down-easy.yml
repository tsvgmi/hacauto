  Verse1:starley 
  Oh my [Am]darling, my darling, my darling 
  We're [Em7]breaking 
  And I [Dm]don't like the feeling of knowing you [Em7]hurting 
  Can we [Am]stop and pretend that this ever [Em]happened? 
  Oh my [Dm]darling, my darling 
  You know I can't take [Em]it 
   
  Chorus:starley 
  Don't wanna be the [F]one to break your [Em]heart 
  But I gotta [Am]tear your world apart 
  I let you down [Dm]easy [Em] 
  I let you down [Am]easy if I could 
  And even though we [F]used to have the [Em]spark 
  I'm putting out the [Am]fire before it starts 
  I let you down [Dm]easy [Em] 
  I let you down [Am]easy if I could 
  [F] [Em] [Am] [Am] [Dm] [Em]

  I let you down [Am]easy if I could 
   
  Verse2:wyclefjam&both 
  [Am]I wonder, wonder [Em] 
  Why good things don't last [Dm]forever 
  It feels like [Em]thunder 
  The way my heart be beating under [Am]pressure 
  Even if the fire's [Em7]gone 
  We'll still light the match when the throne [Dm]ends 
  And even though I lost the [Em]map 
  I'mma find a way back to the treasure [Am]

  You give [F]it, you take it 
  And you [Em]take it when you want it 
  You don't [Am]want it when you got it easy 
  I [Dm]want it and I need it 
  Like an [Em]addict gotta have it 
  But you [Am]keep my body feelin' freezy 
  You [Dm]tease me, back and [Em]forth like a frisbee 
  [Am]Sleazy, every time you catch me so easy 
  [Dm]Please leave, you don't ever [Em]need to see me 
  It'll [Am]never be so hard again 
  I'll make it easy

  Let you [Am]down, let you down, let you down, down, [Em]down 
  I let you down [Dm7]easy 
  I let you down [Em]easy
