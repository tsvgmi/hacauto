:lyric: |-
  [Dm]Everyday my papa would work 
  [Gm]To try to make ends meet 
  [A]To see that we would eat 
  Keep those [Dm]shoes upon my feet 
  [Dm]Every night my papa would take me 
  [Gm]And tuck me in my bed 
  [A]Kiss me on my head 
  After [Dm]all my prayers were said 
   
  [Bb]And there were [C]years 
  Of [A]sadness and of [Dm]tears 
  [Bb]Through it all 
  To[C]gether we were [F]strong 
  We were [A]strong 
  [Bb]Times were [C]rough 
  But [A]Papa he was [Dm]tough 
  [Bb]Mama stood be[Gm]side him all a[A]long 
   
  [Dm]Growing up with them was easy 
  [Gm]The time had flew on by 
  The [A]years began to fly 
  They [Dm]aged and so did I 
  [Bb]And I could [C]tell 
  That [A]mama she wasn't [Dm]well 
  [Bb]Papa knew and [C]deep down so did [F]she 
  So did [A]she 
  [Bb]When she [C]died 
  [A]Papa broke down and he [Dm]cried 
  And [Bb]all he could say was, [Gm]"God, why her? Take [A]me!" 
   
  [Dm]Everyday he sat there sleeping [Gm]in a rocking chair 
  [A]He never went upstais 
  [Dm]Because she wasn't there 
  [Dm]Then one day my Papa said, 
  "Son, I'm [Gm]proud of how you've grown" 
  [A]He said, "Go out and make it on your own. 
  Don't [Dm]worry. I'm O.K. alone." 
  He said, [Dm]"There are things that you must do" 
  He said, [Gm]"There's places you must see" 
  And his [A]eyes were sad as he 
  As he [Dm]said goodbye to me 
  [Dm]Every time I kess my children 
  [Gm]Papa's words ring true 
  He said, [A]"Children live through you. 
  Let them [Dm]grow! They'll leave you, too" 
  [Dm]I remember every word [Gm]Papa used to say 
  I [A]kiss my kids and pray 
  That they'll [Dm]think of [Bb]me [C] 
  That [Dm]way [G] [Dm] 
  Someday [Bb] [C] [D]
