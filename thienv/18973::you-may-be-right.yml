:lyric: |-
  [G]Friday night I crashed your party 
  Saturday I said I'm sorry 
  Sunday came and trashed me out a [D7]gain 
  I was [Am]only having fun 
  Wasn't [F]hurting any one 
  And [D7]we all enjoyed the weekend for a [G7]change 
  [G]I've been stranded in the combat zone 
  I walked through Bedford Stuy alone 
  Even rode my motorcycle in the [D7]rain 
  And you [Am]told me not to drive 
  But I [F]made it home alive 
  So [D7]you said that only proves that I'm [G7]insane 
   
  Chorus: 
  You may be [D7]right 
  I may be [G]crazy 
  But it [D7]just may be a [C]lunatic you're [Em]looking for [G] 
  Turn out the [D7]light 
  Don't try to [G]save me 
  You may be [C]wrong for all I [D7]know 
  But you may be [G7]right 
   
  [G]Remember how I found you there 
  Alone in your electric chair 
  I told you dirty jokes until you [D7]smiled 
  You were [Am]lonely for a man 
  I said [F]take me as I am 
  'Cause you [D7]might enjoy some madness for a [G7]while 
   
  Now [G]think of all the years you tried to 
  Find someone to satisfy you 
  I might be as crazy as you [D7]say 
  If I'm [Am]crazy then it's true 
  That it's [F]all because of you 
  And you [D7]wouldn't want me any other [G]way 
   
  (Chorus)
