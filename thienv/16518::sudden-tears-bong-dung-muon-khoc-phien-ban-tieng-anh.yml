  ]And despite the things that [C ]I know \nI can't just [Bb ]let go. [Am]Of the times
  that [G ]we had \n \nChorus: \n[Dm ]There's only night in my dreams \n[C ]I tried
  to hold onto us \n[Bb ]I feel the tears swelling [Gm ]in my eyes [C Dm\r] \n \n[Dm
  ]The times we had are now gone \n[C ]I face this pain by myself \n[Bb ]And suddenly,

  ]Why can't I just let it [F ]all out? \n[Dm ]And despite the things that [C ]I know \nI
  can't just [Bb ]let go. [Am]Of the times that [G ]we had "
