  Intro: 
  My aunt used to live in Paris. 
  I remember she used to come home and 
  she would tell us these stories about being abroad, and 
  I remember she told us that she jumped into the river, once. 
  Barefoot. 
   
  Verse 1: 
  She smiled, leapt, without looking 
  and tumbled into the [Gm7]Seine. [C7] 
  The [F]water was [C/E]freezing; she [Bb/D]spent a month [Bbm/Db]sneezing, 
  but [Dm7]said she would [F/C]do it [Gm7]again. [C7] 
   
  Chorus: 
  [Gm7]Here's to the [C7]ones who [Dm7]dream, 
  [Gm7]Foolish as [C7]they may [Fmaj7]seem. 
  [Gm7]Here's to the [C7]hearts that [Dm7]ache. [C#dim] [F/C] 
  [Gm7]Here's to the [C7]mess we [Dm7]make. [C7] 
   
  Verse 2: 
  She [F]captured a [C/E]feeling, [Bb]sky with no [Bbm]ceiling, 
  the [Dm7]sunset [F/C]inside a [Gm7]frame. [C7] 
  She [F]lived in her [C/E]liquor and [Bb]died with a [Bbm]flicker, 
  I'll [Dm7]always re[F/C]member the [Gm7]flame [C7] 
   
  Chorus: 
  [Gm7]Here's to the [C7]ones who [Dm7]dream, 
  [Gm7]Foolish, as [C7]they may [Fmaj7]seem. 
  [Gm7]Here's to the [C7]hearts that [Dm7]ache. [C#aug] 
  [Gm7]Here's to the [C7]mess we m[F]ake. 
   
  Bridge: 
  [C7]She told me: 
  [Dm7]A bit of [A7]madness is [Bbmaj7]key 
  to [Dm7]give us new [A7]colors to[Bbmaj7]see. 
  [Gm7]Who knows [C7]where it will [Fmaj7]lead us? 
  [Gm7]And [C7]that's why they [Fmaj7]need us, 
   
  Verse 3: 
  So [A]bring on the [E]rebels, the [D]ripples from [Dm]pebbles 
  The [F#m]painters and [A/E]poets and [Bm7]plays [E7] 
   
  Chorus: 
  And [F#m7]here's to the [B7]fools who [C#m7]dream, 
  [F#m7]Crazy, as [B7]they may [Emaj7]seem. 
  [F#m7]Here's to the [B7]hearts that [C#m7]break. 
  [F#m7]Here's to the [B7]mess we [Emaj7]make. 
   
  Outro: 
  I [A]trace it all back...to[F#maj7]then. 
  [A]Her and the snow and the [F#maj7]Seine 
  [D]Smiling through it, she [Dm]said she'd do it, 
  [A]Again.
