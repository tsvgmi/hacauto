  [F]Help me, it's like the [Bbmaj7]walls are caving in 
  [Dm7]Sometimes I feel like giving up 
  But [Bbmaj7]I just can't 
  It isn't in my [F]blood 
  Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing 
  [Bbmaj7]I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something 
  [Dm7]I could take to ease my mind slowly 
  Just have a drink and you'll feel [F]better 
  Just take her home and you'll feel [Bbmaj7]better 
  Keep telling me that it gets [Dm7]better 
  Does it [Bbmaj7]ever? 
   
  [F]Help me, it's like the [Bbmaj7]walls are caving in 
  [Dm7]Sometimes I feel like giving up 
  No [Bbmaj7]medicine is strong enough 
  Someone [F]help me 
  I'm [Bbmaj7]crawling in my skin 
  [Dm7]Sometimes I feel like giving up 
  But [Bbmaj7]I just can't 
  It isn't in my [F]blood 
  [Bbmaj7]It isn't in my [Dm7]blood [Bbmaj7] 
   
  [F]I'm looking through my phone again, feeling anxious 
  [Bbmaj7]Afraid to be alone again, I hate this 
  [Dm7]I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't [Bbmaj7]breathe, oh 
  Is there…
