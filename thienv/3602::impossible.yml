:lyric: "CAPO 1.  Tone [G\r] \n1. [Em]I remember years ago \n[G]Someone told me I
  should take \n[D]Caution when it comes to love \n[C]I did, I did \n[Em]And you were
  strong and I was not \n[G]My illusion, my mistake \n[D]I was careless, I forgot \n[C]I
  did \n \nPRE-CHORUS. \nAnd [Am]now when all is done \nThere is nothing to [Bm]say \nYou
  have gone and so [Cmaj7]effortlessly \nYou have won \nYou can go ahead [D]tell them \n \nCHORUS \nTell
  them all I [Em]know now \nShout it from the [G]rooftops \nWrite it on the [D]skyline \nAll
  we had is [C]gone now \nTell them I was [Em]happy \nAnd my heart is [G]broken \nAll
  my scars are [D]open \nTell them what I [C]hoped would be \nImpossi[Em]ble, impossi[G]ble \nImpossi[D]ble,
  impossi[C]ble \n \n2. [Em]Falling out of love is hard \n[G]Falling for betrayal
  is worst \n[D]Broken trust and broken hearts \n[C]I know, I know \n[Em]Thinking
  all you need is there \n[G]Building faith on love is worst \n[D]Empty promises will
  wear \n[C]I know (i know) \n \n(PRE-CHORUS) (CHORUS) \n \n3. [Em]I remember years
  ago \n[G]Someone told me I should take \n[D]Caution when it comes to love \n[B]I
  did \n \n(CHORUS) \n \n(Out). [Em]I remember years ago \n[G]Someone told me I should
  take \n[D]Caution when it comes to love \nI did "
