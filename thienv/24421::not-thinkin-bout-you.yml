:lyric: |-
   
  Verse 1: 
  [Am7]I've been telling my [Gm7]friends I'm cool 
  I [C7]finally got you [Fmaj7]out my head 
  [Am7]And if I gotta walk [Gm7]by your house 
  I [C7]take the long way [Fmaj7]home instead 
  'Cause I guess if I [Am7]see you outside and you look all [Gm7]cute 
  And I [C7]won't let [Fmaj7]myself forget 
  'Cause [Am7]every time, every time, every [Gm7]time 
  I see you [C7]I know I'm not [Fmaj7]ready yet 
   
  Pre-Chorus: 
  No, I don't [Am7]want somebody else 
  Feels like I'm [Gm7]going through [C7]hell 
  So I just [Fmaj7]lie to myself just to prove 
   
  Chorus: 
  I'm not thinkin' 'bout [Am7]you- [Gm7]-- [C7]you-- [Fmaj7]- 
  I'm not thinkin' 'bout [Am7]you- [Gm7]-- [C7]you-- [Fmaj7]- 
  N.C 
  I don't wanna think about 
   
  Verse 2: 
  [Am7]You got me [Gm7]feeling things I 
  [C7]swear that I have [Fmaj7]never felt 
  [Am7]And you have a [Gm7]way with saying 
  [C7]words that always [Fmaj7]stick around 
  And if I [Am7]saw you outside hanging out with [Gm7]another guy 
  [C7]Like you're better [Fmaj7]off without 
  No, [Am7]I would try, I would try, I would t [Gm7]ry 
  To look [C7]away 'til I [Fmaj7]convince myself 
   
  (Pre-Chorus) 
  (Chorus) 
   
  Bridge: 
  Suddenly I'm thinking 'bout 
  [Am7]All the times we had [Gm7] 
  Keep on [C7]rushing back 
  [Fmaj7]Get out of my head 
   
  I don't wanna think about 
  [Am7]What I'm feeling now [Gm7] 
  I wanna [C7]push it down 
  [Fmaj7]I wanna block it out 
   
  (Chorus) (Chorus)
