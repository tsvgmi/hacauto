:lyric: |-
  [D]Your voice I [Dmaj7]heard speak softly 
  [D]In love it [Dmaj7]always will 
  [D]My only [Dmaj7]hope is holding [G]still 
  [D]Your touch I [Dmaj7]felt so closely 
  [D]Both leading, [Dmaj7]both give in 
  [D]And with one [Dmaj7]move you moved [G]again 
   
  [G]If there's just one forever, 
  i'd want to spend it where you [D]are 
  [D]To have it [Dmaj7]back i take it 
  [D]We play it [Dmaj7]day for day 
  [D]For just one look, [Dmaj7]one pause, one [G]sway 
  If they should pull one under, It wouldn't change a word at [D]all [Dmaj7] 
   
  [G]Not every crack means thunder, [Em7]and we could choose to land so [D]far 
  [A]Still this boat ain't [Bm]built for weather, [Gmaj7]rocking slowly down she [D/A]goes 
  [A]There's nothing [Bm]i've known better [Em]than a pool of [A6]tides and storms 
  [F#m]I leave you safe at [Bm]home 
   
  With [G6]tired eyes and worn out faces, [Em]darlin I still [A6]see you as you [D]are 
  ... 
  With [G6]tired eyes and worn out faces, [Em]darlin I still [A6]see you as you [D]are
