  Verse 1: 
  (I) gave you a [Em]minute 
  When you [Em]needed an [D]hour [C] 
  [Em]Just to push it aside 
  Instead of [Em]leaving [D]behind[C]you 
  [Em]If any word that I said 
  Could have [Em]made [D]you [C]forget 
  [Em]I’d have given you them all 
  But it was [Em]all, [D]in [C]yo[Em]ur head 
   
  Now we’re burning all the bridges down 
  [Em]Watching it go[D]up in [C]flames I 
  want to [Em]build it up again [Em] [D] [C] 
  And we’re [Em]burning all the bridges down 
  (Be)cause[Em]it was [D]sink [C]or swim 
  [Em]all the way down, down, down[Em] [D] [C] 
   
  Chorus: 
  And we’re burning all the [G]bridges [Am] 
  Burning all the [Em]bridges down [C] 
  And we’re burning all the [G]bridges [Am] 
  Burning all the [Em]bridges down [C] 
   
  Verse 2: 
  If I didn’t give up[Em] 
  Would you [Em]still [D]say you [C]needed me? 
  [Em](Be)cause I walked right into it 
  (I) guess I [Em]made it [D]to easy[C] 
  [Em]If any word that you said 
  Could’ve [Em]made [D]me [C]forget 
  [Em]What I’d give up off the floor 
  (Be)cause this is [Em]all, [D]in [C]my[Em]head 
   
  Now we’re burning all the bridges down 
  [Em]Watching it go[D]up in [C]flames I 
  want to [Em]build it up again [Em] [D] [C] 
   
  (Chorus) 
   
  Bridge: 
  [G]Can we [Am]forget about it? 
  [Em]Can we [C]forget? 
  [G]Can we [Am]forget about it? 
  [Em]Can we [C]forget? 
   
  (Chorus)
