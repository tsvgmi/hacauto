  [D]In the [A]town where [G]I was [D]born

  [D]And he [A]told us [G]of his [D]life 
  [Bm]In the [Em]land of [D]subma[A]rines 
   
  [D]So we [A]sailed [G]up to the [D]sun 
  [Bm]Till we [Em]found a [D]sea of [A]green

  [Bm]Many [Em]more of them [D]live next [A]door 
  [D]And the [A]band be[G]gins to [D]play

  Full speed ahead it is, Sergeant. 
  Cut the cable, drop the cable 
  Aye, Sir, aye 
  Captain, captain)… 
   
  [D]As we [A]live a [G]life of [D]ease (A life of ease) 
  [Bm]Every[Em]one of us (Everyone of us) has [D]all we [A]need (Has all we need)
